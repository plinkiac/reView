Well, Mike, we're back here on re:View to talk about the first two Bill and Ted films.
And, of course, the most famous lines from Bill and Ted are "Be excellent to each other" and "Party on, dudes."
Mm-hmm.
Which is ironic, because these days, no one's excellent to each other, and people continue to party on, even though they're told to stay home.
That's true.
Social distance, dude.
