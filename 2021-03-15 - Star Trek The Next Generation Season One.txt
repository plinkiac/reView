why hello my friend, rich evans
hi mike
i, i see you've had us gather here today
what are we gonna talk about
are we gonna talk about star trek discovery season three
nope
oh
okay well the the mandalorian season two
not that either
the expanse
uh-uh
today we're gonna talk about star trek the next generation season one
oh, my god
so star trek the next generation season one
the dreaded star trek the next generation season one
yes this is the thing the internet wants us to talk about the least
so we both kind of ignored star trek the next generation when it first came out
i was like
that's not kirk
because that this was this had been in like the works for a while
star trek phase two
everybody knows about that
phase two became the motion picture
so it's like a whole back story
i think we talked about this before
and it got off to a rocky start to say the least
for a number of different reasons
yeah
one being gene roddenberry uh was a notorious a notorious prick running star trek the next generation season one
"i feel that it was because he felt cut out of the movies that he wanted absolute control on this tv series"
"and that put a lot of pressure on him when he wasn't in the best of health"
"and also i sometimes think he thought we were all his enemies but we weren't"
there were there were writers that were just quitting left and right
new writers would come in he had this mandate where you know all the characters can't have conflicts
the star trek uh crew
yeah
they can't have inner conflicts
they all have to you know work together peacefully
uh you can't have this you can't have
that now and they're like how do we
write dramatic television when we have
all these rules and
and he would come in and i think i read
that the first
15 scripts of the first 15 episodes gene
roddenberry would take it and you know
i'm going to fix everything there were
scripts that there was no discussion
gene would take them and
and and just eviscerate them or rewrite
them completely
so it ended up being sort of a
not so great experience for a lot of the
actors and
people involved in season one yeah rocky
start
yeah to say the least um and then it of
course found its footing
we're growing something about us compels
us to learn
it's also a challenge when like i feel
bad like
i love star trek the next generation and
i want to recommend people watch it
but i feel bad because i know what i say
i know when i tell you
that you should watch star trek the next
generation you go okay i'll start at the
beginning
that's the logical thing to do and then
you get hit with the encounter at
farpoint
which is one of the better
episodes of season one and it's also
terrible
well that's the thing is like i i went
through all the episodes of season one
and
i found little bright spots here and
there that i enjoyed
and you you challenged me specifically
you challenged me to find
three episodes i like in season one you
say challenge
i say tortured yes
i i i will fully admit i did this for my
own sick pleasure
because i got like i got like two and a
half
oh two and a half like two and a half i
technically have three
i have three and a half oh yeah and i'm
very we don't know each other's picks
yeah i'm very curious to see what you
picked
um because oh boy
there are some episodes i hate and and
and i'm i've almost finished watching
season two now
and there are some episodes that i hate
in season two but there are some really
darn good ones season two is really
weird
one is like consistently uh
season two it's it's
it's got the worst episodes of all time
but it's also got like the best season
two is like
peaks and valleys ironically the valley
is i don't want to say peak performance
[Laughter]
but i thought peak performance was
shades of grey
yeah yeah that joke really would have
worked
it wouldn't have shades of gray it was
called performance
but we all know peak performance is
[Music]
we talked about the production of it how
it was a disaster
everything went wrong uh everybody hated
being on the show to the point where
one of the main cast members said she
wanted to quit
have you been treated well lieutenant um
the writers all hated gene roddenberry
gene roddenberry hated the writers
the production crew hated the actors
there was a real
uncomfortable dynamic that existed
between
what was going on on stage and what was
happening in the offices
um there was real conflict there
you're not careful you could kill
yourself the actors hated the production
crew
craft services hated the actors the
actors loved
the craft service food though
[Music]
uh my first pick is episode called
one one zero zero one zero zero one okay
the the binars episode all right
all right uh and this is an episode it's
it's not
it's not the most complicated plot in
the world uh
let me stop you there yeah that can be
applied to all 26 episodes
of season 1. so the the the enterprise
is coming in to get some some upgrades
to its computer systems
and so it's it's going into starduck
and they reuse some gorgeous
star trek three shots of a star base
they just replaced
the uh enterprise a with the
d going into the dock yes and in 70
years time they built a star dock
that is 55 times bigger
than the star dock scene in the
because did the d is so much larger yeah
that makes sense it fits right in that
door
that's right just
also i believe it's season two
when the enterprise goes oh it's measure
of a man when the enterprise goes
to the the regular one base
and oh boy it is not to scale
the regular one base is a tiny base that
they reviews that model
multiple times and then the regular one
base is
behind it's not that base it's a star
base yeah but it's behind the enterprise
d
and the base is this big and the
enterprise d is floating in front of it
this big
which means the windows on the starbase
would have to be about 15 stories tall
but the the main reason i picked this up
is like
the the main one um
it took some time to flesh out some crew
members this is like the first time i
think of the series we see
the crew like have a life outside of
their jobs
then i'm under my cabin i gotta put my
feet up i'm gonna turn on my personal
relaxation
light am i gonna lose myself in the
pages of some old novel
picard is talking about how he's looking
forward to just staying at his quarters
and reading a good book which is a very
picard thing to do
uh data is she's trying to paint
and his best friend jordy is there
helping him paint and that's
oh that's that's that's a character
thing that is data he's not just on the
bridge saying
i have calculated the odds of us
surviving there's no just just
little you see we see some of the first
human
moments on this show the season one
what i found re-watching season one very
dry
as far as far as the characters go and
it's like just saying tasha yar
and wharf dressed in like some kind of
sports outfits they're getting ready to
play a game together
that those little touches like that was
neat
if winning is not important then
commander
why keep score if winning is not
important then why keep score
yes i don't have much other good to say
about it this is uh
the minuet episode yes yes that's that's
my least favorite thing about it
yeah i mean okay so the premise is the
binars
the binaries are this alien race and i
that's not that's another i guess
i'll get into that later that's another
good thing i like the binars but they
are
like a race that is highly integrated
with their computers
like their their central computer on
their planet is very
important for them to even live they are
so connected to their computers
but the problem is a star near them
has gone supernova which is going to
wipe out their computers for a bit
and that will kill them all so they
need to steal the enterprise so they can
upload their computer onto the
enterprise
temporarily to save their species
so the their whole thing is they're
going to fake this little
disaster on the enterprise that'll cause
them to like eject the ship out of the
stars
hijack the ship they're going to hijack
the ship to save their planet as a
backup in
in case they all pass out and die before
they can finish their task
they they want uh riker and picard on
the ship
just as a backup like you know we all
die
these two guys don't they'll come about
and
they'll solve our problems for us but we
need to keep them on the ship
while getting everybody else off the
ship so they create
minuet rights gentlemen
if this is what you call enhancement
you've got a gift for understatement
because they're so computerly advanced
they
the holodeck is probably just like a
child's toy to them they did some tweaks
to it and they
realized they could create a very
realistic human
uh that riker who is the the resident
sex predator
um he is enamored with
and distracted by and of course um
picard this is a wonderfully awkward
moment where
picard walks in on riker's sex fantasy
[Laughter]
picard's almost got this like smug look
on his face like he knows what's going
on
right no two's company three's a crowd
record's like oh no no it's fine come on
in we weren't doing anything
i don't need your fantasy women and then
we can get into some
unintentionally creepy stuff here
riker does creepier things in later
episodes yeah sure but
one of the things i you have to notice
when watching season one
is just the way they write women
like okay the episode naked now the
drunk virus
all of the all of the male characters in
that show they're bravely holding their
their space liquor like no we gotta oh
we gotta fight this and solve this
problem
all of the female characters instantly
become
man crazy and horny
i'm a woman i haven't had the comfort of
a husband
a man
you wanted me i'm getting sick
wouldn't you rather be alone with me
with me in your mind
and it's the most cringe thing ever so
so you you have you have this the scene
in minuet
where they're talking to minuet
like she's an object i mean she is an
object
but it's it's just kind of you know
works at another unintended level
great job boys but computer
blondes and jazz seldom go together
it's a show that was made in the
late 80s with scripts
that were written in the 60s for the
original show
by writers who grew up in the 30s
now that is truly exceptional
[Music]
see here's the thing roddenberry very
progressive gentleman but
when it came to sex his attitude was
yes please and so he wanted them women
in those mini skirts
i thought that the women's roles i
thought they didn't have to tell me
were um
[Music]
stereotypical and
not thought through uh and
and that they were fulfilling a kind of
archetypal
female television role you know
the token dark-haired one the token in
our case redhead the token blonde with
denise
uh one one zero zero one one binary code
yeah uh fine episode i i kind of like
that the binars are
they're kind of childlike i like okay
this is something else i like them as
like a race
in star trek every other star trek race
is just like normal people
but with [ __ ] on their forehead but we
recognize them as basically being an
acting you know human like frankie's
they're just greedy people basically but
the
the binaries feel alien to me and just
like the way their
society potentially is the way they
behaved
would you like to try the enhancement
all right they communicate
they work in pairs yeah that's the
binars
um and then yeah they're linked to their
partner
and they communicate back and forth they
find speech is too slow
um and the makeup's a little bit more
complicated than just we're gonna slap
some [ __ ] on your nose yes and they're
they're shorter they're
little people yeah they're pink and they
have interesting look to them an
interesting idea that they're so
advanced that they've incorporated
technology yeah it's probably the future
of humanity at some point
yeah um which is which is nice um
and then at the end picard's just like
why didn't you just ask for our help
why didn't you just ask us for help and
they said if we asked you could have
said no
for for a race that's connected to the
computer just all logic
made perfect sense too important to ask
we must do this yeah yeah even though
there was like a 99
chance the federation would have agreed
to help them comp
the computer logic can't take the chance
one percent chance not worth it
yeah so those are some positives i found
i think i just found the the holodeck
stuff creepy oh yeah
oh yeah general unexcitement of it
season one which is season one season
one oh i will say
i haven't i have a thing here in my
notes for the one one zero zero one zero
zero one episode
jordy says the dumbest thing that jordy
has ever said
because um i think it's wesley detects
like a major
anti-matter malfunction i'm reading in
problem with the magnetic containment
field which contains the anti-matter
could you come up here like the ship
might blow up and jordy
says don't tell the captain until we've
checked this out ourselves
we'll go to engineering since that's
where the trouble is wes don't disturb
the captain or commander riker until we
check this out
i sir i was like jordy
jordy he spent a little too much time on
benzar
wait wait wait oh yeah
okay that makes i get that joke
i get that joke it's a good season two
episode
didn't mean to offend you
uh my first pick from season one
symbiosis and i think i mentioned this
to you well that's
that's one of mine very good we can talk
all about it and now i'm left without a
good third
so this is great
this is this might be the best episode
in season one
it's pretty good even though it's it's
very simplistic
again but that's fine that's not bad
yeah i
i have it as ethical and a prime
directive yeah
it's both so the enterprise is is out to
mediate the dispute between two
neighboring planets while they're out
there they run into a freighter that's
that's falling apart the guidance
system's broken and i think it's about
to crash into a planet right
and everybody on the freighter just
seems like they're
drunk well that is a little vague
what is the computer analysis well a
computer's not working very well
or stupid they seem like they're stupid
because i think
like they seem like they're drunk that's
kind of a clue as to what's going on but
at first
you watch you just think they're stupid
it reminded me of the paclids
do you need help we are pack lids
our ship is the mondor
it is broken captain how long have you
been in command of this crater
seven years this is my 26th voyage to
fracker
and you don't know how to align a
control coil never come up
can anyone else over there do it oh hold
on i'll ask
the the lead guy there's two guys uh the
lead guy is merrick buttrick
who played kirk's son yeah it's also a
wrathicon uh reunion because the the
other guy on the from the other planet
yeah he was kahn's henchman oh yeah
that's right yeah yeah that's right
the brekkians yes the breckians are the
bad rays
the guy the one of the breckians there's
a male and a female the male is
is the guy who is cons like right-hand
man
um and then there's a lady brekkie and
they both
their costumes they both look like they
walked off the set of battlestar
galactica
like right out of 1974.
um and it's just it's just great um did
they
did they use costumes from when they
were developing phase two in the
seventies
maybe um but the onarians
are the victim race that's merrick
buttrick and his friend
um and and first of all i approve of the
choice of names
onarians right onarian nice nice
flows right off the tongue and then
brekkians some hard consonants in there
makes them sound bad right and and the
ship is falling apart
and very importantly none of them have
any idea how to fix it or even how the
damn ship even works
which plays into the story later yeah um
and and so they're like
you know picard and riker they're on the
bridge and they're like what do you need
they're like
some kind of space coil and they're like
we could send it to you
oh cool
thanks i guess do you know how to put it
in does anybody know how to put it in
i don't know dave i don't know bob you
know how and so they sound like they're
drunk or high
uh or stupid and so the is just like
baffled like how do you not know how to
fix your own ship you're flying around
in a spaceship
like do you know anything and they just
sound like totally out of it
what is the matter with these people how
can we captain of that vessel and not
understand its simplest function
so through a little little adventurous
sequence
they manage to beam out they lose some
crew members right
the first thing they do is they beam
over their cargo
that's the most important thing more
important than their lives
they beam their cargo over them because
of what the cargo what
get it off the pad beam some people over
they beam over
two o'narians and two breckians are the
the core of our conflict
i want to say right now too by the way
if you have any intention of watching
this [ __ ]
stop right now and watch this because i
think this is better
to watch like when you don't know the
twists that are coming
yeah yeah you could skip ahead to this
time code for our next
pick it's nice that we overlapped here
yeah which is good we don't know our
picks
uh so we're going to continue with
spoilers for symbiosis
star trek season one well that's like
it's almost like a double
twist to this episode because that's
like the first reveal that's like what
you think the episode is going to be
it's like
oh no we need that race our medicine
because our race
has a deadly virus and then you you
think watching this
oh this is going to be a virus episode
then picard goes through all the
protocol he's like wait a minute they're
in the briefing room you know and
uh the conference around picard's like
wait a minute you you're both infected
he's like
medical emergency you know did this get
filtered out during the transport and
records like i don't know solar flares
um maybe picard's like whoa
star trek has a lot of virus episodes
there's a lot of virus episodes um
and so we discover that yeah this race
is sick
um the breckians were on the ship
to bring over
the medicine to onaria these two planets
that are nearby
technically the onarians went over with
their ship to the breckins to pick up
the medicine because
the breckians importantly they don't
have much in the way of technology
the big situation of the episode is
they're they only between the two races
on two different planets they only have
three working spaceships
the first one is destroyed and then they
have
other two with similar problems right
it's sort of like you know your drug
addict with the barely working
1982 honda accord right who's got to go
and get and pick up his uh his stash but
the engine won't start you know
they they have two barely working
spaceships now
that's how they get back and forth
between the two planets the breckians
produce
the medicine the onarians desperately
need it
to to survive this plague
and so the the brekkians say okay well
we'll allow a dose right and so dr
crusher's just got her nose in all the
business she said what's going on you
know
what are your symptoms right well once
we get the medicine we feel pretty good
for about
48 hours and then we start to then it
starts to come back
and she's like interesting virus you
know it
it doesn't have a lifespan it doesn't
have symptoms
it just it just is very persistent can't
detect it in any way shape or form
it seems very much like something else
and she wants to keep her mouth closed
then they show them get their drug
this is little which which they describe
the drug
amount as something something
milliliters
what's the dosage .01 milliliters
but they take the little pill and they
put it in the thing and then they
i don't know how they use it but they're
like ah you know they feel better
and dr crusher's like she figured this
out
rather quickly i like that there's
enough clues that you as an audience
member
paying attention right you can figure
this out on your own before they tell
you
i like that yeah well you know something
suspicious because the brekkians are
just like
they look smarmy and like they're filled
with lies
they're clearly villains they're up to
something yeah yeah and this is i think
another one of those episodes where troy
is conveniently not around
the breckins are just full of total
[ __ ]
they're lying this is not medicine
they're laughing all the way to the bank
but troy's just she's in her bath
she has the week off i don't know um
dejean and romas are feeling fine in
fact too fine
felicium's a narcotic crusher figures it
out
that this is a drug the brekkians
hundreds of years ago figured out that
the plague wasn't really a plague
and when you say by its drugs you mean
the whole race of onarians are just
addicted
to this there's no virus there is no
virus they are
not sick they are just addicted to this
medicine and they they don't even know
it
right right the the president of onaria
like phones
and he's also tweaking he's just like
you got the stuff
or what and they're like we're working
on it yeah we need to stop
done do you have it
yes it is here but
you gotta get into it so please
and then picard calls them out on it and
they're just like
hey you know it works for us man
it's a it's a symbiotic relationship
hence the name of the episode
the breckians have have nothing their
total source of income which is all
these are all very simplified things for
planetary scale
yeah in simplified terms the breckians
have no
industry or whatever they their sole
source of income is the money the bulk
of their society is entirely geared
towards making drugs yes to supply to a
planet that pays for them it's a
symbiotic relationship and they they
knowingly
are the bad brekkians knowingly are the
bad guys because they are keeping them
enslaved
to them by drug use it really should
have been called parasite though
symbios usually benefit both ways but
really
the brechaians are just using the
factionarian so the anariyans don't know
that they think it's a symbiosis
if i could correct you a parasite
usually kills the host
okay okay jean-luc this is not a
symbiotic relationship
this is exploitation pure and simple
well they say well you know now what are
you going to do about it with the sly
grin the
the breckians are just like you have no
jurisdiction here we're not members of
the federation
it's not your business well captain
picard he basically just says
my hand's tight i can't do anything this
is a prime directive issue and then uh
what's her face
the breccian girl just the smuggest look
on her face
you just want to slap that lady right in
the face you just want to slap her face
off you want to slap the 1970s right out
of her outfit
[Music]
go back to battlestar galactica
battlestar galactica doesn't want her no
she's a piece of [ __ ] mike
people are awful but in a sly move
picard knows
knows the solution to this problem
crusher's like why don't you do
something
just [ __ ] bomb the planet breccia and
destroy their
drug facilities like our hands are tied
and so uh david so it comes time
to give them their drugs and put them
back on their ship and off on your way
and they're they're like oh good you're
gonna you're gonna give us the the new
classic coils we need you're gonna fix
the other chips
and picard's like nope in this situation
the prime directive prohibits me from
helping you
that's absurd you did not think so when
it worked in your favor
you can't do it no he they've lost
they've lost the way to um
to transport the the drug and so the
prime directive has tied my hands here
too right and that slapped the smug
right out of her [ __ ] face
like eventually these ships are going to
break down and we can't
move the drugs back and forth well the
onarians are going to have to go through
withdrawal
dr crusher assures them once you get
through the withdrawal you'll be okay
well they don't even know about the
withdrawals because they don't even tell
them they don't even inform them of that
yeah yeah it's just something they have
to deal with and and picard's
non-interference policy
the prime directive applies perfectly
here now
could the breckians like put out a
message into space like hey
we got a bunch of money can we buy some
spaceships from
you know to solve this problem maybe
maybe picard washed his hands of it and
did his best and said
uh this is how i want to solve this
problem engage
[Music]
and so season one contains a bunch of
weird things
that doesn't happen in other shows i
just wanted to make note of
they there's the the sun
their their star is solar flaring up
right which gives both races
some kind of ability to use like solar
energy to i don't know if they say
that's why but yeah they both have
electric powers
the electric powers are from the sun
which doesn't really have a point
it gives one of the it gives uh i'm
calling him david because that was his
name in
wrath of khan it gives david the ability
to take riker hostage
like near the end yeah no we need our
drugs i'll kill him
which which is a an interesting
alternative to just pulling out a phaser
saying don't move you know yeah uh but
could that have played into the
the plot of you know maybe you could use
your solar energy to help you get over
uh your um withdrawals or
like what was the point of that
specifically not it didn't really have a
conclusion
i think it was they didn't want to make
them look like idiots because they
didn't confiscate any phasers they would
have had on them
okay okay they had i think the point was
to give them a weapon that
tashiar couldn't confiscate yeah and
then another interesting
like thing that whoever wrote this put
into it was when they approached the sun
picard goes uh and then they mask it
with a little black dot and so i always
thought
huh that never happened in later
episodes like yeah you look at the sun
even from the distance we are from it on
earth
but imagine being in a spaceship
relatively close to it how that would
[ __ ] blind you in a second oh it's
sucking 10 forward
oh yeah you can't put up the dot and 10
forward no
um but i i i attribute that to maybe the
view screen has a filter
you know you put on those glasses to
look at a solar eclipse
maybe the view screen has an automatic
filter built in but i thought that was a
neat touch
yeah i found that interesting i also
want to point out the most
80s thing ever happens in this episode
when uh in the middle of mr t showed up
the name is mr t
first name is mr middle name is that
period
last name is t no well he might he you
know what he may as well have
because tashiar and wesley that's on my
list they have
they have the dare psa the more you know
what i can't understand is why anyone
would voluntarily become dependent on a
chemical
like mr t should have showed up at the
end of that that's right don't do drugs
kids on my home planet there was so much
poverty and violence that for some the
only escape was through drugs
yeah that was um i don't know if you'd
call it cringe or cute
it's cute of its time yeah
and you see like i did a little reading
up on denise crosby and tasha yar
and it was her decision to lead the
leave the show
crosby asked to be written out of the
show because the large ensemble cast
just left no room for her to explore
many of her own
acting frontiers because she felt she
wasn't doing
much you know what watching season one i
i think i get it a bit more because they
did not really use touch
tashi r much in season one not as much
as i kind of remembered her being used
right it was no longer fun to be there
anymore i thought this is not this is
not
fair this is not fair to them my other
cast mates
this is not fair to the legacy of this
show and it's not fair to me
to be in a place that i i didn't want to
be in
and i was beginning to to you know have
feelings that i didn't like the irony is
if she
if she lasted into like season two and
three that's when they started focusing
on the
characters more she probably would have
been fleshed out a hell of a lot more
yeah
i mean she had uh they've she mentioned
the
living on the planet with the rape gangs
um
and then they had they show a flashback
in season one
of her escaping a rape game
now run this place isn't safe at all
but her complaint was yeah she just was
basically like
i'm saying lines and she didn't the last
episode
where her character died was um
skin of evil and in the beginning of
that she has some kind of like
conversation with wharf
and she's like if only my character had
more moments like that where i got to
act
you are favored in the ship's pool
you bet on me a sure thing
and and do something and say something
important
um and this is one of those moments
there's like three
in the whole whole first season
and her telling wesley all about drugs
naive little wesley
why would someone intentionally become
addicted to a chemical
well they only make you feel good
temporarily yeah
it was such a dare moment yeah it was
cute but uh skin of evil was not her
last episode filmed oh
um this this was the last episode she
filmed this was
interesting yeah there's a there's a
famous exchange between her and rick
berman
the producer one of the producers on
star trek you know i know who rick
berman is
where he has tasha yar's combat
and he posted a tweet that said um
here's tashiro's combat
tasha gave it to me on the last day of
filming her final episode
skin of evil and then denise crosby
responded and wrote
you're wrong you prick um
my last episode of filming we filmed out
of order
technically with symbiosis
you grabbed my combadge from me and said
you won't be needing this anymore
oh damn so denise crosby put him on
blast
so it's a relatively famous exchange on
twitter
but as noted in one of my next episodes
wharf in that position
just feels so much better him up there
there's even a scene where
tasha and wharf are both on the curved
council
the tactical station and he's doing
something here and she's doing something
here and you just
when those shots are there low shots and
wharfs up there
it just it just feels right listen and
listen good
i'm talking to you
i have i have two kind of half pics
left out of 26 episodes
i've i've got one episode that i liked
but i have almost nothing interesting to
say about it because i have no notes
i just wrote the episode name down
and that's terrible i have another one i
don't know if you want to talk about
this
i have it written down i took notes on
it because i remembered
liking this from season one and then i
sat down to watch it and it was crap
oh boy well you're you i don't know
where to start here you pick it
all right i guess i guess i'll talk
about the one i kind of remembered
liking
but it was crap all right because it's
more interesting to talk about
i hope it's not one of my favorites it's
the neutral zone
ah yeah
the neutral zone is a an episode
where cards he's off the ship having
some important meetings somewhere on the
enterprise sitting around
waiting for them to show back up but
they scan some old
space debris floating around and because
they got the extra time
dado wants to check out this ancient
piece of technology in space the
opportunity to examine such an ancient
vehicle does not come around very often
and as you pointed out we do have the
time
and they beam aboard and uh wharf is
confused by old-timey doors that you
had to physically open yourself yeah
it's like you just he like tries to walk
into it he's confused because it's not
opening
on the on the ship they find
cryogenically frozen people from
our time and i remembered it
as being this cutesy episode where
people from our time get to wake up and
uh it's we're in the future now
and it's a cute little thing and
instead they're all horrible [ __ ]
except for the one lady except for the
one lady but they you know
they take them aboard but the crisis is
at the same time they're finding these
people on board
the car gets back from this meeting and
it turns out they want the enterprise to
head into the neutral zone
because for the first time in 50 years
the romulans might be causing trouble
this is the season finale this is the
season [ __ ] finale because on the on
the in the neutral zone
some federation planets have just i
think that they've
lost contact they're seemingly gone and
we have to go investigate that
while we're investigating this this
incident that might lead to a horrible
war
we've we've got these defenses from the
20th century on our ship and we got to
deal with that
i for one never had a doubt my stock in
this company
must have split at least a dozen times
by now that that's uh
a space cop joke comes from that the guy
who's unfrozen and wants to check his
stocks
oh god that's a direct reference and i
missed it he's concerned with wealth
yeah this is where picard famously says
in the future we don't need
money or greed or you know material
things we've solved war and poverty and
hunger
a lot has changed in the past 300 years
people are no longer
obsessed with the accumulation of things
we have eliminated hunger want the need
for possessions we've grown out of our
infancy
this is one of those episodes that kind
of just does a little bit to establish
what life might be like on earth which
we rarely see now
this utopia without without without
money we don't need money it's
not a problem you don't have to worry
about your stock sir you don't have to
keep bringing it up every two minutes
there's three characters three
characters from the past there is sad
housewife
there is comical joke country singer and
then there's business business business
yes who's all about business and he's
got his business
i for one never had a doubt that my
stock in this company
must have split at least to make a phone
call as soon as possible
a phone call well yes i have provided
and control it's really it's all about
control i want to say he has a mild arc
because at the end he
storms on the bridge and kind of helps
it's not even it's not even an arc
we see the romulans for the first time
and we're on the view screen and we find
out that the romulans their
their colonies have been disappearing
along the border too so it's
there's some kind of mutual threat that
both the federation
and the romulans have to worry about
turns out it's the borg
but none of them know that yet and
picard's trying to figure out what the
romulan's like tell us what you know
about these colonies that disappeared
and the romulans are being all koi well
we could tell you but yeah and then
business guy
shows up on the bridge they haven't got
a clue
they're hoping you know but they're too
arrogant to ask
because he wants to talk to picard he
wants to see the manager like he shows
up on the bridge
for no [ __ ] reason just i have to see
what's going on because i am
that ass i'm the [ __ ] character and
i'm gonna be an [ __ ] and he just says
no they they know what they don't know
what's going on they're lying
that's that's his only contribution
that's not an arc all right i
i figured it was bigger than that no
that's let's see that's the thing i
remembered it as being bigger
i remember in my memory i haven't seen
this episode in 20 years
i thought he had an arc he's so good at
business and reading people
and negotiating deals he
he just he could tell that an alien
species is lying
but it was obvious they didn't need him
this is another episode where troy would
have done the same thing
she was mysteriously absent from the
bridge or just sitting there
i think she was mysteriously absent for
the bridge i
i think she was handling uh sad
housewives problems oh okay yeah she was
helping her look up her
descendants or something ten generations
of your progeny
everyone i've ever known is dead
yeah none of these people seem very
grateful to be alive
500 years later yeah there's no trace of
my money
my office is gone what will i do
it uh it just seems like a waste of an
episode where they they could have said
something
but they didn't say anything for a
season finale
i mean i guess they were teasing some
big threat that was
supposedly threatening both the
federation and the romulans but
uh they should have had maybe something
a little more exciting happen
should have been maybe more focused on
the romulans because this is
this is the big reveal this is like
we're seeing the romulans again for the
first time
since the 60s yeah and we we get that
glorious reveal of the
the new romulan warbird it's one of my
it's one of my favorite
[ __ ] spaceships and it's wasted in
this episode
but uh i'm really i'm really glad you
didn't when you prefaced it by saying
an episode that you thought was great a
long time ago
you know you were watching and sucked
i'm really glad you didn't say
conspiracy because i knew that sucked
right from the beginning
i always hated conspiracy everyone
everyone always says
conspiracy is a good episode from season
one and i'm like what the [ __ ] are you
smoking
i mean it's oh god they didn't know what
to do they wanted to
establish a big thing coming up they
wanted to establish a big
threat but star trek
the next generation to me it doesn't
need a big threat star trek the next
range is all about feeling good
feeling calm star trek the next
generation feels like
home all that kind of paranoia there are
enemies in our miss [ __ ]
was far better suited for deep space
nine and it was done
far better in deep space nine the the
[ __ ] threat with the stop-motion
beetles
picard meets some uh some captains on a
secret planet there's a [ __ ] thing
going on
oh this sounds really good oh it's bugs
it it wasn't the ride show for that kind
of thing
just next gen yeah it was too early it
was too early deep space nine had to
mature yeah
you had to care about the world more i
think first before you got to tearing it
down i don't know
and the yeah yes yes that's a good point
and the villain was silly
yeah a bug that crawled in your mouth
and took over your body and
their whole approach to um like
getting the the scene where the admiral
tries to get riker to eat a bug
come have a look i think i'll summon my
science officer
it won't like your science officer it
does
like you like okay so
put a hypo spray in his neck when he's
not looking done
you know he's like [ __ ] open the cage
look at the bug it's a life form you
haven't seen before it wants to crawl in
your
[ __ ] mouth and ricker's like ah
security to the quarters help
bad approach if you have this vast vast
conspiracy to take over the biggest
the biggest united federation of planets
in
in the [ __ ] galaxy you better
have a better plan than that you know
that episode conspiracy was also
roddenberry's
[ __ ] you to the studio with the censors
like [ __ ] you i can do what i want
i'm gonna have the goriest [ __ ] death
i want to have that's why the enemy at
the end of that just kind of melts
oh his head blows up his yeah yeah
and which i thought was oddly excessive
because all they did was
a fade a crusher phasered the old
admiral into a subconscious and then the
bug crawled out of his mouth
ronberry was trying to make some kind of
weird point against somebody
okay that was the thing i think ramek
was the
the queen alien he had the monster
inside of him so maybe he couldn't
be saved but picard didn't know that so
they just aimed their phasers and blew
his head off that episode sucks
yeah so does my episode that i'm talking
right about now though
the neutral zone that's the neutral zone
it sucks
enjoy it
my third pick which i thoroughly enjoy
and or love an episode called
the arsenal of freedom oh
uh it's it's great there's some there's
some problems with it
it's almost like a guilty pleasure
because it's not i don't think you could
call that like a smart episode
no symbiosis ethical and prime directive
uh my next episode the arsenal of
freedom i wrote fun adventure
yeah and i have a third one um that's a
character study
but uh the arsenal freedom what else
could you want
from an episode of star trek in season
one
[Music]
that's not dull
[Music]
that's adventurous and exciting
and fun i will give you this the arsenal
of freedom the episode the premise is
the enterprise
arrives at a planet called minos in
search for the uss drake
which disappeared investigating the
planet minos
all the people are gone um when they get
there
they get an automated salesman who
appears on their view screen
who's trying to sell them weapons of war
and at first picard thinks he's talking
to some guy but it turns out it's a
recording
it is a recorded message sir uh this
planet got
super wealthy selling weapons to two
different planets fighting each other
people's races fighting each other
whatever they got there and there
they should have just immediately left
but they have to investigate the drake
so riker toshiyar and data beam down to
investigate
and um the planet's overgrown with
vegetation this probably happened
hundreds of years ago yeah no
everyone's dead everyone's dead or gone
equipment's still working
the equipment's still working to to sell
you
weapons if you want to buy them so they
beam down and riker runs into
captain rice the captain of the drake
which has just recently disappeared and
he's old friends with him they went to
the academy together and he's like
he's like hey and he's like hello will
riker
keeps asking him like weird questions
yes he's like what's the armament of
your spaceship
so rikers detects something suspicious
so he plays a little prank on him
and he's like he's like my ship uh it's
called the
the lollipop it's a good ship what is
the armament of the lollipop like he's
like okay
no the name of my ship is the lollipop
i have no knowledge of that ship it's
just been commissioned it's a good ship
there's something wrong with you so it's
just a holographic projection
of someone that they scan the data banks
and you know
it's a very smart sophisticated weapon
system and then the fun part is when a
drone comes out
and starts shooting lasers at everybody
and they're on some terrible set
like like next gen like later seasons
like
they got all got in the van and they
drove out to the desert of california
um to to film in in in
real life you know and some of the early
sets in seasons one and two
yeah they're like tos sets where they're
on a sound stage
and there's like there's like just a
monochrome sky
and plants like potted plants everywhere
the planet looks
terrible but the concept's fun
and so they have to defend themselves
against these drones that are attacking
them that just get more get more and
more powerful they keep adapting
uh and then riker is encased in like a
bubble where he's like frozen
and picard's like okay this situation is
getting bad i'm going to beam down with
dr crusher
they fall in a hole dr crusher horribly
breaks her leg
and so then it becomes like a survival
episode
um since so many senior staff members
are down on the planet's surface our
b-plot
involves jordy being put in command by
captain
card i think by far the best part of the
episode yeah
battle stations there's one there's a
section of the show that didn't quite
develop it's the picard and
dr crusher on their they fall in a cave
in the ground or something
they needed a really good they needed a
really good bonding moment
which they kind of worked on dr crusher
tells picard she starts like
letting him know uh she knows about
herbal medicine she's like break that
rudolph over there
and is is there like a material in it
maybe it can cauterize my
you know blood clot yeah in my leg how
do you know so much about roots she's
like my grandmother
lived on this colony and and we all know
about we all know about dr crush's
grandmother
see seven seasons later we learn all
about dr crusher's grandmother which was
a nice thing
they brought it all the way back to
season one um but but there's always
this
teeming sexuality sexual tension between
picard and crusher
season one they they tried to write it
like that was a
big major subplot that was gonna be
going on it fizzles out yeah
um star trek naked now there's that
that when they're drunk they've got that
super attraction to each other
um and then in the in the show attached
that's when like six years later
somebody said oh yeah weren't weren't we
supposed to be shipping them
which which dr crusher again mentions
her grandmother in that episode too
the sharing of thoughts and feelings is
quite compelling
very but but the and attached
it opens with them having breakfast
and it ends with them having breakfast
and and they have a totally different
understanding of each other
and this picard saves crusher's life
essentially
helps her you know with her leg and then
they get rescued
there's not a scene at the end of this
episode it's like they get beamed up and
rescued and then it's not
resolved at the end you know picard
could have come into sickbay
you know beverly says thank you for
saving my life john luke
you know personalize it no problem
beverly
i need time we'll talk more about this
in the future you know
season i think season one episodes like
in general are like
focused on whatever the plot of that
episode is
and they don't they don't season one i
think one of the problems overall
season ones they didn't stop to smell
the roses with the characters like that
you
you're missing those moments you're
missing like
there's no rikers poker games in season
one
it's all we've got to stop the thing
that's the thing this week
we've got to work out the problem yeah
but you know
as much as i like tos that's a lot of
tos
it's very little backstory except for
spock
you know the miner character is forget
it
oh yeah but this this it's like yeah you
after seeing all seven seasons of
next-gen you want those moments
in those early seasons and really it's
just like let's uh
picard finds the computer
and uh you know so is it a deus ex
machina ending
more or less right just yeah we want to
buy your
your stuff problem solved i think that's
really clever i do
like the the ultimate resolution of this
episode where they stop the robots from
attacking them
by buying the robots because their
salesman it made it made
perfect sense it was a way to wrap it up
but um
the you said you mentioned the more
interesting beast
story of the show does kind of deal with
the the forbidden roddenberry
interpersonal conflict which was
interestingly enough the more
interesting part of the show
why are we still in orbit we're taking a
beating we've got to hold out as long as
we can now if we can disable our
attacker if only for a few seconds
we can drop our shields and beat the
away team back aboard jordy is put in
command
jordy is um not the chief
engineer in season one he's just
lieutenant
jordy laforge can i say how odd it is
it's season one
for all intents and purposes there is no
set chief engineer
that's so weird well i think there's one
guy that shows up a couple of times the
fat beard guy
the fat beard guy he disappears and then
there's a different chief engineer yeah
i think like there's like you know there
was no counselor
in tos i think they wanted to say like
let's have different roles
like scotty scotty was like third in
command
whenever kirk and spock and mccoy were
gone scotty was in charge
always yeah um he was you commanded the
enterprise
like he's the next in line and so that
was like in this situation
with your doctor who's a commander
riker and picard gone really the next in
line is the chief engineer
or i guess the second officer data who's
also gone
in view of the present crisis i believe
you should relinquish command to me
no i i'll rank you mr logan
i'm in command yeah the chief engineer
comes up and
you can tell he's he's one an [ __ ]
and
two probably a little racist and he's
like he's like
yeah the captain did not anticipate the
enterprise would come under attack
if he had would he have left the bridge
to you if he had he wouldn't have left
the ship hey captain picard
put me in charge until he gets back i'm
in command and so there's like
jordy's like stressed out troy can
tell that he's really worried he doesn't
know what he's doing
um and then on top of that he's got two
young uh ensigns that he's got to take
to the battle bridge
that are also an experience and he being
inexperienced and nervous himself has to
be the strong leader for them
he has to project the leadership and the
confidence right
and so it's a growth moment for jordi
laforge
surprisingly in an early to a season one
episode
yeah engage
it's a rare moment when separating the
saucer section
seems like a good choice because usually
in season one
like the first time they separated the
saucer section in in uncountered far
point
they just wanted to they would have
never ended up doing it in later seasons
and in later seasons when you're like
separate the saucer section
they should have did it far more than
they did really anytime any time
they were heading into something they
knew was dangerous they should have been
putting all of the families on the
saucer
and jettisoning that [ __ ] jordy's in
orbit
and then a bigger version of the drone
is flying around in orbit
attacking spaceships shooting at the
enterprise the enterprise can't handle
it
um it's going to come back in a bit
jordy has to make the decision
do i let this engine this bossy [ __ ]
engineer take command
and do i back down to him or do i make
my own decision his decision is separate
the saucer send it away
which is an amazing amount
of space action and adventure for a
season one episode
it's just a fun fun all-around adventure
episode that
is surprisingly tight and not cringy or
racist
[Applause]
okay i i i guess we're we're back to me
then
but we kind of already talked about what
would have been my number one pick it
would have been symbiosis
so i don't i don't really have another
one i gotta i gotta
get a half half pick if you wanna talk
about it i have a half pick as well
oh that's wonderful i i wrote down home
soil
that is by half and and
in my notes i i have nothing written
down
under home soil i just have home soil
written down
because i mean it's all right
home soil feels very tos
it reminds me of devil in the dark but
just done worse
oh yeah yeah yeah yes yes home soil is
an episode where there's a
there's a planet with some some
colonists who are terraforming the
planet
and they they s stumble across uh there
was
what is starfleet said in there here
well you know
this this is my point this is my notes
this is my point of comedy right
okay the enterprise the enterprise
visits to check up on their
progress right is that all it was it was
just
we're seeing how you're doing and their
arrival
causes a cascade of events that destroys
multiple people's lives
so they show up right and the old man is
just like
we're fine we were a little behind but
we're back on schedule
leave us alone and troy being nosy
troy's like
he's hiding something it's a good thing
we had troy for that it's a good thing
he's hiding something captain he doesn't
want us to come down there we're fine
we're working on the thing we're a
little behind
what's going on just forget it go away
he's hiding something he's like well
we're coming down
director manuel we've heard of your
remarkable achievements in terraforming
my crew would very much appreciate
looking around this is not really the
best time
ah fine they go down thank god we had
troy
and then they meet the the innocent lady
who's
who's plucky and excited and
just loves terraforming and is so
excited
and the the visit by the enterprise
ruins her whole life
her whole life so they come down and
they start snooping around
and then they get a guy killed
[Applause]
you know i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
defend troy here they actually had a
clever use of troy
in this episode because she senses that
someone's in danger because she sensed
their distress
and usually they just have troy say
obvious things about a character like
he's hiding something we'll know [ __ ]
but this time
she actually she's actually useful yeah
she wasn't in time to save the guy
but but it was kind of like an early
warning thing just because she sent
somebody was in peril in the other room
right right i like that yeah so one of
the workers the terraformers goes in the
the laser
digging room the laser drilling room and
the the
there's little pieces of tiny glass
like that are alive
and when they come together with like
saline or salt or something
the saline works like as salt water
works like a conductor
yeah and so they become a life they're
basically a life form
of of something that's beyond our
comprehension it's a life form that is
so
different we didn't register it as being
a life form it wasn't like any
life we've seen before so these poor
people have been on this planet for 25
years terraforming it
and when the enterprise shows up that's
when the life forms make themselves
known
one of the terraformers gets lasered to
death in the laser room
and then um they're like oh god now
we've got to investigate this and then
data goes into the laser room
and then it tries to kill data
[Music]
the data's too smart for it so he rips
the lasers out of the wall
the other guy comes in and goes oh my
god these lasers
they cost a hundred thousand dollars
i use work destroyed
and uh they're irreplaceable i had to i
had to [ __ ] rip them out of the wall
and trash them
because i'm data oh god why won't you
people leave
mike if if the enterprise didn't show up
these these terraformers would have
destroyed this intelligent life form
it would have been a shame it would have
been a shame but then then they discover
the life forms and they
bring them on the ship and then it turns
into a different episode
yeah they start to take over they start
to grow
and then it changes from uh we're
investigating the weird things going on
into this planet episode into a
this thing is taken over the ship
episode it's fun it's fine i'm not
saying it's bad
episodes take or take a turn yeah
humorously enough they refer to
the the collection of crystals as the
micro brain
meaning the micro brain might be
photoelectric
that's okay because the collection of
crystals refers to humanity as the
ugly sacks of mostly water ugly
giant bags of mostly water bags of
mostly water
but i find it funny because later on q
calls wharf micro brain
pity you might have learned an
interesting lesson
macro head with a micro brain
i guess it's a prime directive episode
primarily
uh they realize that the crystals
are a life form and then picard says
i guess you're done with this planet
pack up
and get out yes i guess a couple of
sparkling pieces of glass when they come
together they are
sand crystals i guess they're super
small when they come together they
they can think and they're different
than us and
we should respect that you know that all
that star trek stuff
but it's just kind of funny how clumsy
and disastrous
the whole scenario is see it reminds it
just
reminds me of a tos episode that was
done
much better over 20 years beforehand
called devil in the dark just some
similarities where you got the
colonists with overall so instead of
terraforming they're mining
and this life form just keeps killing
off the colonists
and the enterprise has to show up and
then
similar to home soil and devil in the
dark we find out that the life form
is intelligent and it's just trying to
defend itself from these miners
who are destroying its offspring yep
it's protecting its eggs
mr vanderburg what is this
it's a silicon nodule there are a
million of them down there no commercial
value
it's against the famous spock mine meld
with a big
blump turd it's got one of my favorite
like kirk and bones moments where
uh bones is trying to heal this life
form that's silicon
based kind of like the sand crystals oh
and he says damn it i'm a doctor not a
masonist
or something like that not a
construction worker and kirk's like
damn it bones you're a healer now he'll
help it treat it i'm a doctor not a
bricklayer
you're a healer there's a patient that's
an order but in the end instead of the
colonists lives being ruined
they learn to work together with life to
their mutual benefit
enterprise the enterprise doesn't leave
with an
entire industry and people's careers in
ruins
by just swinging by to see what's going
on
i guess they saved a couple of grains of
sand
well lastly let's talk about my last
pick which i reluctantly picked
now i'll remind you this was after
re-watching all the episodes i've always
hated this episode or kind of
not really cared at all but
considering all the kinds of stories
they tell in
the first season of star trek uh it gets
it gets a nod it's heart of glory the
wharf
episode where there's a there's a weird
freighter
that's in distress and they beam over
all kind of action-packed opening and
they discover
on this freighter which is not a klingon
freighter they discover three klingons
and so they're like okay we got to
rescue them beam them over
and um and so it's a really the first
real character-centric episode
and i don't like klingon stuff i don't
like
dwarf klingon politics i like wharf a
lot
yeah yeah i agree um wharf has so many
great moments
i just saw one the other day when i was
watching
the episode with the fish people you
know
and they've been and they're like these
these ugly fish people that are frozen
and wharf just goes
handsome race what a handsome race
that's just so like awkward what was the
worst trying to like pick out a wedding
gift
yeah yeah just warmth trying to pick out
like like looking at fancy
feminine glass amusing about that right
yes
there is a female voice asking if we
want room service
the royale when they discovered that the
astronaut lived to 100 and died in his
sleep and
were just says terrible way to die dying
peacefully in your sleep
yes that's a horrible way to die
looks like the poor devil died in his
sleep
what a terrible way to die so wharf
conflicting with
with uh human culture you know the
differences
and there's also a funny bit too season
two
uh riker makes riker tries to make
breakfast for everybody and it's [ __ ]
awful and disgusting
pulaski hates it jordy hates it but
wharfs like scarfing it up
he just says delicious and of course
wharf eats live worms so it's not
it's not the best uh compliment to riker
delicious you know yeah but it's funny
it was cute
so in addition and wharf's not just a
joke
you know he's a good character and um he
has good
good scenes but typically i don't like
klingon politics stuff this one is out
of the norm
because these klingons beam aboard and
in in future episodes kligans are just
awful to wharf
and in this they're fairly polite
even when the klingon commander aboard
the
like a it's like a d7 battle cruiser
it's reused footage from the motion
picture
um of a klingon ship approaching and
he's like he's like
my brother helped me we need to find
these fugitives because the klingons
turn out to be fugitives
yeah and um well they're they're
klingons that have rejected
like peace basically yes does it make
you gentle
has it filled your heart with peace
because klangons are at peace now
they're basically terrorists yeah and
they don't want to
adhere to the the peace treaty the norms
they want they want to be warriors and
to have glorious battles they want to be
martyrs
and um so that's why they steal this
vessel but then they're like oh
you know this one we have heard
this ship can separate in time of battle
yes
when relieved of its bulk the enterprise
becomes an exceptional weapon
we've got one of our own on here he'll
help us right and
and warf's loyalties are tested albeit
very
not very strongly tested yeah you know
like wharf knows better than to run off
with these jackasses
they're not really testing them but we
learned it's weird that this is early
enough that as an audience
you might doubt wharf's loyalties yeah
because watching this now it's like yeah
yeah right but there's there's not
they you know they're like don't you
want to die in glorious battle
and it works like you know kind of they
make they make fun of humans they're
like
you want to sit around and
live in comfort and injury peace they're
like making fun of them and
he's like do you mock me um but worth
smarter
than these guys and um but still there's
that conflict
and it's a there's a part of wharf
that would love to run off and join them
in battles and glories
yeah a bar yeah they so they concoct a
scheme to steal the
the battle bridge and use it to just
[ __ ] blow [ __ ] up and and um
for no real reason too it's not like
they it's not like they have one enemy
they're focused on right they just
they just want to cause trouble captain
picard
give us access to the battle bridge if
we will separate from the rest of the
ship
then together we will light up the
galaxy
imagine the fear that will rule before
us yeah yeah they're
kind of insane yeah and and then so
we're introduced to the klingon death
ritual the
opening of the eyes and screaming and
dwarf takes part in it
and really at the end they're put into
the brig
and they escape one of them dies the one
last one is up on the
top level of the uh
yeah he's he's pleading with wharf and
wharf just
[ __ ] murders him and he does it right
because that's the way the guy wanted to
die so in
in doing that he also respected klingon
culture and he gives him the klingon
death
death chant at the end here's what i
want to say about this episode
how important is this episode to the
development of
not dwarf but klingons the original
series
the klingons were very different yeah
culturally they were very different
right they were just general
bad guys yeah like we didn't start
getting modern klingons i think the
first time we really
saw one outside of a cameo with star
trek iii
yes yes we see them in the motion
picture
we see the new makeup in the motion
picture but they don't do anything but
blow up
yeah they just yeah they're just like ah
kill it kill it
and but three is when we get more that's
i think the most
uh the first kind of idea of klingon
culture
hierarchy uh the captain just executes
people on the ship we discover they're
basically like
really bad space pirates or something
like um
i don't know how you would describe them
i'd say pirates is
pretty accurate they don't they don't
really like
attack other ships and loot and steal
but their culture is very
um i don't know barbaric yeah but yeah
in next-gen terms
this is where you start fleshing out
their their culture their honor system
yeah that's why this is a watershed
episode because it really introduced us
and i think that's what um
like if i were to guess just blindly i
would say they
made this episode and they said well
this guy
uh that we had just as a random
character is much more interesting
as a guy who's in charge of security
than tasha yar let's get rid of her
yeah this turns out this guy we had on
the show just
just to establish that in the future
klingons and humans are friendly look
there's even a klingon starfleet now but
yeah
now he's a character uh yeah and wharf
also talks about
his backstory uh attack on kittemur
and his his foster parents he even
mentions his foster brother
who shows up way later
decline yes
this is my brother wharf he's come to
help us yeah that's uh
that's it i wanted to talking about
heart of glory made me think of
some of the interesting stuff and this
is technical this is
shows budget related you know obviously
we don't see ten ford until season two
but we see an early version of ten
forward
it's just like a room with a window they
have a they have a
uh i think it's haven they have a
like a dinner scene there uh heart of
glory they don't have a brig set yet
the wonderful brig set that we see in
later seasons
so they're just they just walk into like
an empty room
down the hallway um
uh and then in one of the later episodes
we'll always have
paris there they show he's playing
fencing and what looks to be
like a half constructed gymnasium
which kind of looks sort of like the
shuttle bay
and they only shoot it from one
direction and you could kind of see the
wall
because an earlier in the tashi yar
episode when she does the
uh it demonstrates her like karate
skills they go into the holodeck to do
that not a gym
season two when riker does um the
the death the death
the ultimate expression of martial arts
they have a whole room devoted to it and
it's like a gymnasium kind of room
so obviously season two they built
bigger sets but it seemed like
the the fencing scene was like a shuttle
bay about to appear
because i don't think they showed a
shuttle bay in season one at all
you know what i don't remember i should
have kept track of [ __ ] like that i
don't think so
there's a lot of work in progress with
season one yes
it's a really season run is really weird
the way i when i was watching season one
i
kept feeling like uh it was just made by
entirely different people
oh yeah yeah yeah like none of it felt
like a show where they just had the same
sets and identical twins of all of the
actors
you know different people writing it
different people producing it different
people
filming it characters are played
differently
yeah it's a it's like prototype tng
right you can hear the voice of the
writer
um there's an episode later on i think
it's season two where riker keeps saying
hold fast
like like dwarfs like what should i do
hold fast dwarf
and it's like okay is that some kind of
military term
like rikers never said that in any other
episode
as as the show moves on they they they
iron all that out and it becomes much
more consistent this is how this
fictional technology works
this is the kind of terminology they
would use to say these things yeah
yep somebody figure it out and gene
roddenberry stay out of it
he was he was too sick by that point
it's probably what made the show better
yeah but um anyways i hope you enjoyed
i did not okay i did not enjoy it but it
was
it was curious i'll say that it was
curious it's an interesting experiment
after ignoring season one for 20 years
going back and watching it with like
fresh
eyes and and kind of like understanding
a little better
of why it's bad or why certain episodes
don't feel right
or this changed that changed et cetera
et cetera
it's a good experiment to do yeah um but
i hope the audience at home enjoyed us
talking about it
hopefully and if there's one thing to
take away from this
start at season three yes
yes why do you say that
maybe go back and watch the couple
episodes we talked about here
but you could kind of skip the rest of
it because i think i saw like a comment
on one of like
our older videos it was like um you know
i think of
tng and i think that show has an age
today what are you talking about i saw
like a comment yeah i started watching
it and
it's kind of dated like what oh they
started in season one
no no of course you would but no
i feel like such an idiot quite right so
you should
anyways thanks for watching bye
and please don't ask us to do top videos
from season two i guess we will
that'd be easy that would be easy one of
them was already uh
for our top picks a measure of a man
yeah yeah that's true so
might be there might be some redundancy
if we go through all the seasons but
i got i got one from season two that's
continually barely missed out
my top picks what is it
you know what's interesting though rich
no one
in the whole world is talking about star
trek discovery season three
not a single person
