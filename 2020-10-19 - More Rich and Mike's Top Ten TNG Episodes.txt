well, rich
we said we'd be back
we're back
back, baby
talking about star trek: the next generation
a 30-year old, outdated television program
so let's get into it
rich and mike's second top-five top-ten--
well, it's a sequel to our top-five, which is really kind of a top-ten
second half of our top-ten
rich and mike's top twenty star trek: the next generation episodes
so what we're doing is a top-ten, but only the bottom half
but really, that's the top twenty
rich during the commercial break we
flipped a coin the quarterbacks from
each team
selected heads or tails i won the toss
uh but i defer it to you oh my god so i
could start off on the second half
that sounds that sounds fine uh i have
uh booby trap as my number 10.
booby trap there's no coincidence the
word boob is in booby trap
because it's an episode about jordy
laforge being perverted
it's it's an episode about a horny jordy
laforge who in the middle of a crisis
finds love with a woman who doesn't
exist maybe we can do it again sometime
uh i i i like jordy i heard you once say
that jordy was boring
and i i i completely disagree with you
this is the b and end all of jordy
laforge episodes
it is the only jordy leforge episode uh
with the exception of the terrible
episode where his mother is a ghost
and he flies in a fire pit to find his
mother's ghost
uh which is terrible jordy is an
underrated
every man what everyone says about tng
is like i want to live there i want to
be in that universe i want to be friends
with these people and
i think jordy is probably the only
person who might actually
bother to be my friend because levar
burton is just so
naturally friendly which is why he
hosted reading rainbow for
30 years well it looks like a great
party do you mind if we join you
also the other thing i like about jordy
from a writing perspective
they never used his blindness as like a
crutch outside of
outside of the first season i think
that's one or two episodes but it's
never like
jordy episodes aren't i'm blind and i
really wish i could see jordy we have
the surgery
but you can only see for one day with
your reel
they never fucking did that and i i i love that they just kind of sidestepped his disability
he's like yeah he's he's got the visor but
he's just like everyone else this
episode starts out with him
on a date on the holodeck and
he's just he's just striking out with
this with this woman
and um he's trying too hard
he's he's trying the standard you know
whine and dying here's the romantic
evening
and he's he's not just being himself
which is his problem which is why
when the the i guess i'm getting ahead
of myself
well no i think that's that's a what the
the track you're going down is perfect
yeah because i'll i'll i'll help you out
here a little because
i was like booby trap okay that's that's
that episode you know where they're
they're stuck in the the booby trap that
sucks the energy when they try to move
it shoots radiation at them there's
trapped
that's the episode where jordy makes the
holographic lady right
and they kind of sit there and you know
and then i rewatched it
and i discovered a wonderful little
subtext
lair you know i've always thought that
technology could solve almost any
problem
but sometimes you just have to turn it
all off
and the whole episode is is is basically
about relying too much on technology or
just letting go
and being yourself taking a step back
and that's that's
jordy's problem in the beginning and
it's it's painted out
so clearly and that's what's so great
about a lot of these episodes
where i'm noticing which i'm going to
talk about timescape later
it's on my list where there is a
wonderful opening
segment that that basically sets up the
theme
of what this episode is about and that
carries through to the end
jordy is on the holodeck there's a lady
he likes
there you know he says you want another
coco no no
he's trying to get her drunk uh he's oh
she's it's a little cold he's like i
could turn down the breeze you know and
they have a beautiful
ocean setting and then he then he makes
the guy with the violin come out
i pro i programmed the holodeck perfect
and she's just like
no you know and then mid-episode he
talks to gainen and he's like
gaining what am i doing wrong you know
and she's like you're doing just fine
with me
you're just being yourself she always
knows what's what and and
and that ends up being the arc of the
entire episode when we get to the booby
trap part
yes because because the the enterprise
discovers uh
an absolutely ancient distress signal
coming coming from this this little
asteroid uh belt
and and they go there and they find this
ship that's like 1 000
the other the other half of this episode
the picard bit is uh you know
card is very much into uh archaeology
and picard is geeking the fuck out
about this 1 000 year old ship usually
picard's pretty
reserved and he's very visibly
giddy in this episode he gets to go on
his ship in a bottle
something they reference is like a scene
where picard is
all it's like building a ship in a
bottle you ever do that and nobody
nobody fucking else it's like what the fuck what the fuck is this crazy old man talking about ships and bottles
it is exactly as they left it number one
in the bottle
the ship in the oh good lord didn't
anybody here build ships in bottles when
they were boys
except except for o'brien who who
decides to suck up
i did sir thank you mr o'brien
in that particular moment i build ships
and bottles sir
i love how he asks it to wharf and david
we're
like i didn't play with toys dave's like
i was never a boy
and and he does he connects on a certain
level with his counterpart
aboard the ship and that counterpart was
in charge of the lives of all the people
on the ship which is the
arc for picard at the end so so we we
you know picard
geeks out they explore the ancient ship
and they they all go back to the
enterprise it's okay
it's time to go home oh no
we fall into the same snare that killed
them
a thousand-year-old booby trap
because the enterprise can't leave
because apparently what happened to the
ancient
ship is it got caught in a booby trap
and when they try to leave these like
devices hidden in the asteroids that
just
suck off all of the enterprise's power
as it's trying to leave
it's like a it's like a figure trap yeah
you know the more the more
power they use to get out the more the
trap keeps them in in place
picard needs jordy to figure out how
to get them out of this trap we need we
need we need to out think this trap
and so then jordy gets sucked down this
rabbit hole where he
he finds the notes of uh leia brahm
who helped design the enterprise and he
just bit by bit he kind of ends up on
the holodeck with a holographic
representation
of of leia brahms so in in the holodeck
without the without trying to to a lady
just just being himself as an engineer
falls in love with the hologram of dr
leia brahms
because he's he's not trying he's not
trying to war he's not trying to get out
here's the roses here's the wines like
well you know i'm engineering problem
let's figure out this engineering
problem and that's that's jordy's things
being himself he's an engineer
and he gets to be an engineer with this
other engineer
don't go away
i mean a computer safe program
yeah and to be fair uh
she is a little overly warm
and receptive which we discover several
episodes later
which in real life she's not but that's
a whole nother story
that's the sequel episode which is also
good which is also good
the fort so you're the one who's fouled
up my engine designs
but yeah like when you when you watch
this episode
uh which which for in my memory was was
sort of just like
okay episode but when you watch it and
you say it's an episode about how the
enterprise gets caught in a booby trap
that radiates the ship when they try to
leave and everyone will die
what happened before that is the surface
level
the real story is jordy learning to
cut loose the ties of technology and to
be himself
and to be more more uh confident
in in his natural persona not to over
overthink or overtry with everything
yeah and
and that is the problem when cut trying
to come up with a solution to escape the
booby trap
uh he learns his lesson and they they
parallel
each other his his love life and the
escape from the booby trap end up being
similar because the solution to escaping
the booby trap
is to not overly rely on technology he's
like we got to do this we got to
rewire this and we get six percent more
power if we we
wire this to that section and then and
then he's like wait a minute the
solution is
don't do anything turn it all off turn
it all off
but not if we shut everything off
one blast of everything we've got left
for a microsecond to beat the inertia
and then we shut it all down
except for minimal life support and two
thrusters
no impulse engines no computer and so
that's where
you know picard's arc comes in is picard
the best pilot on the ship
no arguably riker is
but that's not the point the point is
picard says this is my job i'm the
captain
the my counterpart i have respect for
him
but he didn't get his crew out of the
situation it's up to me
looks picard's also talking about like
you know his ship in a bottle his
back in the old days they didn't have
the instruments to rely on they just had
themselves in their
navigational equipment yeah did it on
their own right and then picard
steers the ship like that he wants to be
he wants to be
the old he says something about uh
imagine having one propeller
to keep up the aeroplanes manning the
earliest spacecraft
flying an aeroplane with only one
propeller to keep you in the sky
can you imagine that
now the machines are flying us and so
essentially that's what they do
um i thought it could have been a little
a little more
exciting at the very end when they shut
all the power
off i was i was just picturing in my
head where it's like
you have this action music and all the
all those
all the terminals go off you show all
the parts of the ship
everything goes dark you know people
have flashlights and
is a little more exciting but that's
fine they spent a little too much time
in the middle where jordy's like
you know chit-chatting with the
holographic leia brahms
and i was like okay okay and then they
get out of the
i don't think it's an asteroid field i
think it's the remnants of like a planet
was that what it was okay
neither side expected aurelius nine to
be the decisive conflict
there's not much left is there the
destruction is remarkable considering
the primitive weapons of the period
they referenced the fact that the battle
was so like crazy and violent like blew
up a whole planet
and it's just like floating debris from
a uh battle
that occurred i think yeah so the
solution is
cut everything but minimal life support
and just use like one thruster one
little
burst from the impulse engine just to
push the ship
and then just a little bit of thruster
almost like like
you're coasting your car you know you
turn off the engine
you you keep the heat on maybe and
that's it and your car just kind of
coasts
down a hill we're out of gas put it in
neutral we'll take the
gravity down the hill so the layman
equivalent to that and picard picard i
think does a little trick
he he he does picard has the the human
intuition
he does the thing the computer never
would have thought to do
when we don't we don't have enough juice
to make it picard uses the gravity of
the giant asteroid
to kind of swing the ship the rest of
the way out
data's impressed yeah you have used the
asteroid's gravitational pull as a
slingshot
excellent yeah data's improv a
sophisticated computer
in the 24th century and would never have
thought of that but that's okay
picard did it's a theme you'd probably
never see nowadays it's a very like
1980s
attitude towards technology yeah we're
so fucking reliant on computers now like
shutting it off would
would never be the solution i i like
that episode it's number 10
in my top 20.
number 10 in your top 20. yeah there's
one one one little bit one little bit i
liked
brent spiner is good at acting like he's
faking emotion it's just just just a
tiny little thing
once once jordy strikes out on his uh
hollow deck date the beginning wesley
sees jordy walk into 10-4 and goes
uh-oh and then data
is confused at first once data realized
the date failed
completely emulates the uh oh that
wesley just did
uh-oh commander dated to the bridge
immediately
yeah and it's so obvious that he's
faking it it's perfect
there's another moment like that in an
episode that i'm going to talk about
called the game
when wesley comes back and they surprise
him in the room and wesley tells a joke
everybody laughs and data kind of goes
for a second there i thought i was on
the wrong ship
so wesley and it's like he never really
did that too often
but um it is it is pretty obvious and
funny when he does it
it's always clear when he was faking
yeah yeah yeah so a a good episode
i love the little uh uh jordi it's a
good jordy episode
and i think this is one of the earlier
ones where i remember thinking
they really upped the game on the
special effects because a lot of those
shots where the enterprise is like
moving through the asteroid belt or the
debris field or whatever yeah look
really good and um
i think this is like right at that time
when
it started to look really good and it
used to it used to be kind of a dull
episode but i appreciate
what it is now how do you feel about the
very ending
when picard's command is
let's make sure that no one gets caught
by this booby trap ever again and record
goes
mr wolfe 45 photon torpedoes fire make
sure that booby trap doesn't bother
anyone again
mr wharf ready photon torpedoes set
to detonate on impact with the promelian
vessel and then they just blow up this
ancient ship
you're at the point where you have to
wrap up the episode
even though that would have that should
have broken picard's heart
yeah and he he probably could have said
why don't we put out a little warning
beacon
because they've done warning beacons
that's for let's get a team
of highly specialized starfleet
engineers
to think about this and then a fleet can
come in later
and try and disable it from a distance
and maybe we can rescue
this this very valuable piece of ancient
history that i love
so much yeah yeah but there was no
clarification on his command
it's like riker riker's got a little bit
of intuition in him i get that you know
but
mike the episode's gotta be 46 minutes
we got 12 seconds we're at
45 uh 52. we gotta end
i just wanted picard to go no no no i
meant a warning buoy
and then riker riker is in the brig
that's how it ends no
that's a nitpick it's just a fun little
gag picard gets kicked out of his
archaeology club
yeah you destroyed a promethean battle
cruiser
so it's like blowing up the fucking egyptian pyramids
somebody got bit by a snake
let's make sure no one gets bit by this
snake again
fire a nuclear missile destroy the
priceless artifact
blow it to smithereens
yeah yeah yeah like indy firing a
bazooka at the ark he couldn't do it
yeah right right okay even though it
would have stopped the nazis you didn't
want to blow up the ark of the covenant
you're right rich yeah it would have
been a nice ending uh
but it had explosion at the end made
made people happy
but great pick rich booby trap thank you
don't go away
okay mike so what is your next pick my
next pick
which i'll just go right into it the
order doesn't really matter there's no
particular order
um but i referenced it in our booby trap
review it's the game
the only good wesley crusher episode now
let me go on the record with a very
unpopular opinion
i don't dislike wesley crusher
really he's better in later seasons i
think a lot of the wesley crusher hate
comes from season one i've never really
got i never got that vibe of of i hate
wesley crusher
watch this
it i'm i'm
i'm with starfleet we don't lie
i'm not like fully on the bandwagon
where i have pitchforks and i want to
see the character
beat it up but he's kind of obnoxious in
that first season when
he's so much smarter than everyone else
and
half the episodes revolve around him i i
get why he's disliked
it's wesley i wanted to speak to you
about the boy
and such musical genius as i saw on one
of your ship's libraries one called
mozart who is a small child wrote
astonishing
symphonies a genius who made music not
only to be heard but
seen and felt beyond the understanding
the ability of others
wesley is such a person he's
rottenberry's insert character
i think brown bears what his self
runberry's like self-insert almost
see i always i always thought it was
more cynical than that i thought it was
like
well you know this show is
has a bunch of old people on it stuffy
old people
let's throw a kid in there maybe young
young people
13 14 15 young boys will be like
cool you know like i want to be like
wesley i want to go on adventures in
space with you know
forward view screen is controlled from
the ops position there which uses
high-resolution multi-spectral imaging
sensors
hell do you know that boy perimeter
alert captain leslie
i'm sorry get off the bridge more of a
marketing thing
like like a relatability we need
something for the kids yeah a red light
ability that could be
kind of like how riker is the william t
reicher is the james t kirk you know
it's through he's he's the suave
handsome guy who sleeps with ladies and
good you know
we don't want a stuffy bald diplomat you
know
what how young kids are they gonna like
this and that's kind of how i got wesley
but
um i i never like the i guess
what would be the worst wesley episode
is when he falls on a bunch of flowers
and they want to execute them right
that's the planet where any ever
literally every crime carries the death
penalty yeah yeah yeah
and so they have this perfect society
and then they're it's really like like a
good legal episode you know
like he didn't know but we got to
respect their laws
the game is like uh invasion of the body
snatchers
kind of episode i'm trying to decide if
it's a wesley episode
it's more the female uh crew member who
never shows up again
oh episode ashley judd ashley does show
up again
does she show when she show up again she
does come back again
lefleur what's the resonance frequency
point three four over standard i don't
know if it's just one time or a couple
times but she just has a couple lines
here and there
jordy's like lefleur you know what are
you reading on your screen over there
and she's doing something in the
background
it's in one of the episodes that i
watched i can't remember which one
exactly
i guess it's similar to barkley once you
have them on for that season's guest
star episode
you film a couple other little bits that
you can throw in here and there during
the season just to remind
people that that character exists ashley
judd
was the famous daughter of a
country singer she wants to act
everybody you put her in the show
and you know oh she can get two or three
episodes
that sort of thing so um she does come
back but um
wesley comes back from from starfleet
academy he's taken a break
from being at the academy and he has a
lot of venture aboard the enterprise
thank goodness he comes back
or else the flagship would have fallen
into the hands of the butt heads
an alien race with butts on their
foreheads but really
this the whole thing is riker's fault
riker riker is a sex pervert he goes to
raisa
to sleep with a butt headed
he gets no uh retribution or
punishment for what he did almost
you know he should be in jail he was
told it was a
game yeah okay okay i guess i guess
he should at least be demoted in rank to
ensign
you wear the the game on your head and
scoring points in the game is like
getting hit with a straight shot of
heroin yeah it
messes with the endorphins yeah it's a
pleasure we get to see riker's o
face which is unfortunate
we get to see a lot of people's old
faces we see dr crusher's old face
uh we see wesley faking an old face uh i
don't know
incredibly uncomfortable scene with a
girl he's he's interested in
let's land the bed in my quarters and
pretend we're fucking our own brains
um but anyway the premise of the episode
my favorite bit though
with this with this game is that who's
wesley i think is in the turbolift with
the
nurse uh ogawa ogawa and she's like
wearing it
she's clearly just tripping out the
secret is
just not to play the game it plays
itself
that's great there's some peer pressure
there's some drug use themes but it is
it is a a brainwashing device
it is a uh invasion of the body
snatchers
kind of premise where everybody uh is
bad
and uh what so the but it starts off
with
riker on rhiza and riker hooks up with a
floozy
right off the bat they're they're
playing around right they're goofing
around
and they're running around and this is
these are the little touches that i'm
talking about when i watch the show
right
they're not just like she's not just
like ooh come and get me
come get me any chases around what does
she do
i know they're just playing around in
the bedroom i remember what specifically
she has taken his combadge and she's
teasing him with it
and he's like i need that that's
important
and then she throws it out the window
right there
riker you know she's up to no good
and it's a nice little it's a nice
little way to set the stage
she's up to no good and she usurps his
authority
she takes away the one thing that's
that's ties him to the enterprise
there's something wrong also something
he could use to call for help if it goes
bad and he
he's on to her so it's it's it while
subtle
and it looks like just general horseplay
it's a it's a nice little little like
because you you look at the episode from
a writer's perspective and you're like
what do you have them do they have them
just smooching right
they just they're just smooching and and
she goes hey why don't you try this game
no she steals his combat that's some
subtle clever shit
it's very telling of of her character
and her future motivations
because i think she's the one at the
very end her hair is in a bun and he's
all in military uniform
and riker should have blasted her i knew
i shouldn't have ever trusted you
but yeah so it's like little things like
that so you think it's a riker episode
and and this is what i'm talking about
where you have that opening scene and at
the end riker
and troy should have been sitting in ten
forward and he's like you know troy
i should vet these i sleep with
you know like i've learned my lesson
i've learned my lesson i shouldn't go to
raisa
and sleep with any butt-headed female
alien
who just walks up to the bar next to me
right
i've learned my lesson but instead it's
a wesley episode
which is fine wesley comes home he gets
the cold shoulder
the senior staff is in a meeting you're
supposed to go to your mother's quarters
oh the fake cold shoulder which is great
because he's like the chief of brian's
like everybody's in the in the
conference room do you mind if i stop in
he calls wharf
i suppose that would be okay we're so
mad
um wesley crusher has arrived
monson over he can stop by the
observation lounge to say
hi i suppose that is acceptable
that's his setup is he's he's he's
feeling like alone he's feeling he he's
not
with the enterprise anymore he's an
outsider technically
and there's a new brainiac uh
wunderkind who has taken his place robin
leffler
she's the young young uh girl who's on
the upstart and
right so keep it up lefler keep it up
lester
you're gonna go places remember she's
majority singing her praises
she's the new and her and um uh wesley
kind of spat a little
why aren't these registering you might
try calibrating them manually
excuse me the detectors they tend to get
temperamental
you can try calibrating them by hand you
know she's like
i heard you did this and i do i do this
here and he's like
we changed this around and wesley's out
of his element he's an
outsider and that plays into the theme
of the plot which is
uh everybody starts fucking turning on him
and something's really something really bad
is going on
pound cake tarvokian pound
cake another thing i'd like to talk
about which we
we really didn't bring up in our first
episode or two of this whatever it is
we're doing talking about our favorite
tng episodes
tng love fest tng love fest um
it's kind of looking at these episodes
more from a structure
perspective like we're talking about
openings setting the stage
who's the what character is the show
going to focus on what's the overall
theme
because you have a little plot right but
you always have an overall theme
and then also um x because i kind of
like
i was like documenting why do i like
this episode
right what what makes it work and
a lot of times it's you have your your
introduction the these shows are done in
five acts right
you have your first actor your intro um
before the
credits start and that tells you what
the story is and then you have
four more acts basically commercial
breaks at the end of
each act there's something changes
and you know it either intensifies the
drama
or you learn something new and the story
changes
directions things get worse and worse um
and
and and a lot of times i'd be like why
did they end this act that way
which i'll talk about timescape but i
think the the structure of this one
solid introduction riker on rhiza hooked
up with a lady who shows them a game
discs and cones and i like the fact that
when they remastered the blu-rays
they didn't update any of the special
effects they recreated them
to look as terrible as they did back in
the day
but intro is riker on ryza with the lady
uh and she shows him the game he
discovers
uh that it's a very pleasurable game cut
to credits
first act riker comes back from riza he
he initially tries to get geordi
interested in the game
right and he's like jordy you know hey
brought this thing back from ryza
it's pretty pretty cool you know and i
think that's that's also a way for the
story
to let you know that it does work on
jordy because that that was another
question too
it clearly wouldn't work on data but
would it work on jordy and
riker goes right to jordy we get that
out of the way right out of the bat
jordy you wanna try this game i'm busy i
gotta we're doing a survey of the
phoenix cluster a bunch of stars or
something
uh i gotta i gotta work on all this
stuff okay fine he leaves you know some
other things happen
wesley comes back he's chit chats with
picard about
his days at the academy yada yada who
does he go to next
it's a crusher wasn't it was it who's
next
counselor troy oh yeah and
a wonderful little little touch in the
writing what's troy doing
oh god i've watched this recently and i
don't remember
is she sitting in her office with a
patient she just got done with a patient
counseling a patient nope what she doing
i don't remember she's sitting in 10
forward all by herself
gorging on chocolate ice cream her
addiction
she is a secret glutton
for chocolate ice cream and she's
talking about the the ritual of how she
she does her ice cream boom perfect
target
right that's a wonderful thing to have
the character doing
wonderful wonderful action that lets
lets riker know
she's a good target to to be interested
in something pleasurable
because she's she's eating ice cream
right didn't think about this shit
when i was 11 years old right what a
genius little thing to
you don't she's not just walking down
the hallway and riker says hi troy
i brought this thing back from risa
would you like to try it oh sure
no it's it's subtlety she's she's she's
she's indulging herself in ice cream
and but that's the end of act one is
troy's like tell me more about this game
music swell
commercial break what is it just a game
the game spreads around the ship what do
they have to do dr crusher to data
data here do you have a minute to join
me in sickbay
i need your help with something yes
doctor on my way
data is going to be immune they got to
take out you need to take care of the
data problem and that
is when the stakes are raised yet again
because he's not just
he's not just spreading it at that point
now they are actively
doing harm now their subconscious is
there there's a plan it's not just a
game that everybody enjoys playing
that's that's
you know like drugs or something that's
more sinister it's more sinister than
that and that's when we discover that
it's more sinister
uh is is crusher presses data's off
button
and then riker and troy come in they're
like seal the doors
you know let's get to work on cutting
his servos so that he doesn't wake up
then we're like oh my god something
really bad's going on
meanwhile wesley and robin leffler are
kind of flirting and
and they're both kind of nerds so
they're not interested in the game
i think they go on a date crusher is
really pushing wesley hard she's like
try it
come and try it try i'm going on a date
i'm trying to get ready
bring her back here we'll play the game
together and he's like no
no so they go there and they turn
forward and everybody's like
like hooked on this game and and wesley
in true nerd fashion
says i think i'd like to learn a little
bit more about the game before i try it
because that's what that's what people
you know when someone offers you like
cocaine or heroine or
you know i think i'd like to read up a
little bit more about this cocaine
before i try it hey that should save the
enterprise
that's right i wonder how it works
why don't you try it and find out i'd
like to know a little bit more about it
before i try it
abstaining nerds uh
uh who who don't give in to peer
pressure save the enterprise
thank god wesley is a wet blanket
so they go back to um they go to the
science lab and they're looking into it
and blah blah and
oh this thing's psychotropically
addictive it's a real problem
he goes to picard and of the third
act really raise the stakes
is sad we find out picard is secretly
infected when
crusher goes to him he's like i found
this thing it's sinister we should look
into it
the car's like yes i'll look right into
it and then the second wesley leaves the
card just
waits and waits it's like a beat he's
puts on the thing yeah
he's doing something in the foreground
he's like out of focus and and
come you know and then turns around and
and he clearly put the game
in right in wesley's uh sight line but
it's it's a four by three television
show no one noticed that
it's on their tiny little tv screens but
yeah and then wesley then you know
final acts is uh wisely realizing that
robin has been
probably forcibly made to watch the game
play the game
and then it becomes a wonderful little
chase
where they try to get wesley he's the
last one you know
as it's a secret alien plan to take
over the enterprise the enterprise has
been secured
we'll wait for further instructions
by evil aliens and i have another
episode that's virtually identical
to it it's a better episode it's a
better episode but i i i enjoy this one
a lot because
is it is it a weakness that that data
saves the day
in the in the wesley episode no because
um
they uh intentionally kept that from us
uh we don't see wesley repairing data
we don't know that data has been
repaired so there's still that that
tension and excitement at the end
it's kind of lame how data saves the day
by flashing a flashlight at everybody
but you know hey it worked but had they
had a scene
where wesley sneaks into sickbay and
fixes data
and says data there's this bad shit that's going down
i will work on a solution
wesley just keep them occupied we didn't
know wesley was keeping them occupied
we thought he was down to his last and
they push him into picard's chair and
they
hold his eyes open and everything and we
think oh gosh
all is lost there comes data
saves the day is he so often dead
it's a fine episode and i'll get into my
it is my uh it falls into my
ramping up a problem episodes i've
discovered there are two
types of episodes and i'm discrediting
all the schlock
wharf soap opera crap
there are two types of episodes the
escalating problem
episode right where something starts off
small and it gets worse
and what i call the pick up the pieces
episode
where in the very beginning something
big happens
and then the rest of the time we're
picking up the pieces this is an
escalating problem
episode i'm sorry internet
i don't mind wesley crusher i don't hate
him i don't love him
he never bothered me as much as he seems
to have bothered other people
i really don't care like like many
things with star trek the next
generation he improved significantly
after the first
season right tractor beams are my
specialty skipper i'll contact you when
that's done
wesley out wesley
wesley
that's this pick um for for
my ninth ranked episode
i am going with first contact
for me the reason i like this it's kind
of similar to who watches the watchers
in that it's a a a first contact
prime directive-ish episode
that's told from the the aliens point of
view
what are you
like the main characters in this really
really isn't like card
it's it's the the alien scientist
and the the the alien presidents we're
we're basically we
we have this world that is kind of kind
of similar
to earth today and they're right
on the verge their scientists are right
on the verge of developing
warp technology they're they're about to
go
out of their solar system for the first
time at 12.4
after launch the warp field generator
will be activated
that's when it would break the light
barrier yes chancellor
if we're successful the craft will leave
our star system
and in a matter of minutes we'll be on
its way to the garth system
and and the federation who are just just
kind of keeping a track on all these
aliens in in you know the area
they they they know that this area that
the federation knows this planet's on
the verge of going out in space
and so they're preparing to make first
contact with these people for the first
time about to beam down
and and say hello and before
starfleet does this they they actually
have people on the planet
in disguise we're just kind of like just
scoping out
the the culture like how are we going to
be
received so they have little
observational teams running around
unfortunately commander riker who is in
disguise
on the planet he he he gets injured
during a riot that's going
on on the planet and so then he is
in medical custody and the doctors on
the alien planet
discover that riker is an alien
i had cosmetic surgery to correct a
genetic birth defect
and these another birth defect
and it's it's kind of this diplomatic
situation where
uh you know cards he's got to make first
contact
but he's he's also kind of got to get
riker
out of there and this alien culture
they're they're uh pretty paranoid in
general
what if there's more of them they could
be everywhere gordon off the wing
i want security on his door 29 hours a
day and i want this kept
quiet well from i haven't i haven't
rewatched this one
from what i recall there was sort of
like a
a clash of um ideologies there was
there's like what would be considered
like
religious conservatism that were like
we're the only
people in the galaxy like the doctrine
says
and then the then the more like
liberal-minded kind of like we gotta go
out in space there's alien planets
there's other life out there kind of
that sort of like conflict was happening
there's
there's it's it's not specifically
said like the religious and this is our
religious doctrine but there's clearly
the conservative faction right the
people were willing to accept your
social reforms because they believe in
you chancellor
but there are many who say we have gone
far enough
that likes things the way they are
they're very
kind of resistance to change a little
bit
paranoid and then there's clearly a more
progressive faction on this planet who
their
scientific progress and we need to we
need to grow and we need to
change and then in the in the middle of
all of this
this political right and left wing on
that planet there is the
the chancellor who is a character i
really like because he's just like a a
very
classical concept of what a president
should be what a leader
should be he's not dogmatic for one side
or the other he's constantly like
weighing the options of what is best for
his people it's like
well i under i see the value of progress
and what progress can get our people but
i also understand the needs of the
conservative faction
and and i have to balance this what's he
doing this november
that's that's that's the thing that
watching this
is very uncomfortable i'm trying to
imagine this
this chancellor getting into a debate
with president trump
and it's so it's so fucking depressing
well i'll get rid of the individual i'm
gonna give you excuse me
i got rid of the individual mandate
which was a big chunk of opinion
that is absolutely a big thing
i think we shall find we have much in
common and much that is not in common
an opportunity to learn from one another
socialize medicine look why don't you
observe what your campaign agreed to as
a ground rule okay
picard makes first contact with with the
counselor
and they like it's like picard has kind
of like met his diplomatic equal
and they they have these these these
conversations with each other we're not
yelling at each other
calling each other shut up shut up
here's what i got to say
what is it what was the word to use con
converse
conversation conversation that's where
two people exchange
ideas okay okay and they communicate
with one another
oh interesting and somebody somebody
actually like finishes a thought
without being interrupted oh my god what
what kind of show is this
what this is truly is science fiction
it's this it's this version of politics
that's
that's very just fictionalized okay you
know it's like it's
it's science fiction basically
he's got this line on this where like
you know he knows that he's not the
center of the universe anymore it's like
uh he's got this line where it says uh
this morning
i will have to say this morning i was
the leader of the universe as i know it
i was leader of the universe as i knew
it sell it rich
this afternoon this afternoon
i'm only a voice and a chorus i am only
a voice in a chorus
but but i think it was a good day
i think it was a good day it's just
it's depressing i love this episode but
it's depressing to watch
okay and this day and age i understand i
understand
yeah what what ends up riker is just
sort of like the catalyst for this like
it's just sort of the catalyst of
everything breaking down
it's as opposed to this just being a
pleasant episode
about uh this alien race learning that
alien life exists for the first time you
gotta you gotta have some
some drama in there does he like fall in
love with
an alien or well that's that's that's
that's why this is like my my ninth
favorite episode and not one of my top
three
yeah there's this this needless kind of
cringe moment in there
where um riker's trying to find a way
to quietly escape so he could get back
to the enterprise but
he's in the hospital and there's like
security all around because they know
he's some kind of weird alien
one of the one of the doctors
i don't know if she's a nurse or a doctor
always wanted to fuck an alien, right
she offers, she offers to help get him off uh she
offers help get him out of the hospital
but
only if riker will have sex with her i
believe you
now will you help me if you make love to
me
it's actually lilith from cheers what
i've always wanted to make love with an
alien yeah okay
kind of similar to your uh kelsey
grammer
cameo because i guess i guess they
filmed cheers like
right next to the fucking star trek tng set
so it's like lola's like can you put me
in an episode
and it's this cringe
comedy moment in an episode that's
otherwise just kind of a happy
drama fiction yeah i really have to get
going all the other
aliens are waiting for me oh it's not so
much to ask
and then i'll help you escape
it's not that easy there are differences
in the way that
my people make love i can't wait to
learn
this could be like um like a classy
1950s sci-fi if you just make it the
humans like
the mr president the aliens have landed
i could see this working as like a day
the earth said still
just just uh style roll reverse you roll
reverse everything
okay okay i suppose grown-up me adult
me would appreciate it more i never i
didn't get around to re-watching this
one
so i don't have much input i remember it
i remember all the
you know the beats and stuff but um and
to me it never stuck out as one of my
all-time favorite it's a favorite for me
because
i i watch this it makes me think what if
what if
what if the aliens landed tomorrow now
for me for me it's this is
the big picture fantasy of what have
this happened i've always wanted to make
love with an alien
okay mike what do you got next
you do realize that we have a large
number of fans
who who don't watch star trek
and have no idea what the fuck is going on right now
they just know that a goofy mask
has suddenly materialized upon your head
why rich i didn't hear a single thing
you said
but what i can tell you is dharmak
and gillard at tanagra dharmak
and zhilad at tanagra
well rich this is the head of the el
adrel
creature from the dharmak episode of
star trek the next generation
we purchased this it is the actual head
of the creature that that
appeared it's like an interdimensional
monster that lived on a planet
it's like a it's like a dumb predator
yeah it's just a creature that lives on
a planet that
uh uh picard and the captain of the
alien ship have to team up
to fight um so this is i think they slap
this
mask together and probably a costume as
well um it
it's not super there's some veins going
on
um but really it was meant to be sort of
like uh two-dimensional
glowing really kind of hard to see so
they
they just put this together but as far
as i know
this is the only one that exists and
it's the actual head
from the monster
oh my god it's fine it's fine
you fucking spend money on a unique prop
and then just throw it away like garbage like that
fuck it
it's fine
it's one of a kind
fuck it
it's a piece of television it's from one
of my favorite episodes
star trek the next generation uh the
episode is dharmak
and it's it's made famous by dharmak and
jalad atsunagra
which is only famous because they say it
58 times in the episode
i really uh i really like this episode
despite the fact that you could nitpick
the logic
of the alien's language to death it's
really
just an episode about communication
you're still assuming this is some kind
of challenge ritual
we can't be certain of that we're only
making educated guesses about their
motivations
no more than that the the reason this
has
never made any of my top lists it's a
quality episode almost almost every
episode of tng is quality but the reason
the only reason this i i dock points
just because their language is so
utterly stupid
in winter it's similar to like
an alien species that can only
communicate in like internet memes
well see i i think there are there are
ways it's like you got the like the
person that tactical
just just suddenly says uh neil degrasse
tyson
hands in air and then the captain
says jackie chan makes the face
we do communicate crying woman screams
that cat
picard hand in face then the guy next to
him
picard and riker hands in face rich
evan's superimposed
sits on couch so you have the universal
translator right
which which uh it's it is it's the
it's the ultimate hand wave without the
universal translator is complete bullshit
it's this device that's never really explained at all like where it is
it's sort of explained in deep space
nine where it's like a device that's
implanted inside of their ears
welcome to earth
sorry we have to success references
did you understand a word of that our
universal translators must be
malfunctioning
where's that reset button
ouch that looks like it hurts my name is
quark
chief financial officer of the ferengi
alliance and
i've got a business proposition for you
but
it it doesn't it doesn't make sense
where
like everyone should be looking like an
over dubbed
foreign film right where their mouths
don't match their lips
yada yada you know you know what i mean
yeah but it is a hand wave where it's
like just don't worry about
it because without the universal
translator
dharmak would be every episode of star
trek
where nobody ever knows what the fuck anybody is saying
you show up and then you'd have to you
have 25 minutes of like oh god can we
figure out their language you know they
just appear on the screen and they start
speaking english and their lips match
their their words for english they don't
it would be too weird if they're like
you know in english was coming out
everyone would be like what's going on
like your
tv audience fine um and the dharmak
episode
i see more metaphorical kind of like
here's what the story is as opposed to
the logic because
with language you know you have words
like
uh super technical words to describe
like the intricacies of building
machines
you know and you can't communicate that
in metaphor
do you know what i mean yeah so so
language is super complicated and it
works on like a
casual conversation level timber
his arms open
give me more about dharma from the ocean
on the ocean but it basically it's just
an episode about meeting an alien race
and and not being able to communicate
with them
and there's al there's many layers of
of that theme in the episode it's about
overcoming a communication barrier
yes and and clearly the main part of
that is picard and
the captain his name is not darmok it's
uh captain
oh shit
he has, he, his name's mentioned, like, once
uh it's paul winfield the actor who um
who plays the alien captain he was in
star trek two the rather khan
yeah and so it kind of also reminds me
of that enemy mine movie with dennis
quaid
and uh lewis guys guys
they have they have an entirely
different culture
the their idea is to beam down both
captains and have them work together to
stab at this creature which is something
from their mythos
maybe something that happened a long
time ago dharmak and jalad
on an island called tanagra and they
fought a monster
and and they want to recreate that that
mythical
event with the new captain so that they
could you know form a bond
well what's what's going on is though
because nobody for like a hundred years
nobody has been able to understand this
alien race their language is just
impenetrable and now this alien race
they want they i forget how they signal
the enterprise but
they want to try again to communicate
federation
vessels have encountered tamarind ships
seven times over the past 100 years
each meeting went without incident
however formal relations were not
established because communication was
not possible why
and out of desperation uh
the the dharma i'm just gonna call them
the darmox they kidnap a card and take
them down to this
dangerous planet and the enterprise
because they can't communicate
communicate because they can't
communicate communicate communicate
because they can't communicate doesn't
know what the fuck is going on they
don't know if this is a hostile act
right so there's there's a lot of
tension where they the you know riker
doesn't know if this is a
act of war yeah riker riker does what
he thinks is best he's trying to get
captain picard off the planet
you're holding our captain i want him
released
your action could be interpreted as an
act of war until
his eyes closed and so they try sending
a shuttle down
the aliens just nick the shuttle and the
engine so it doesn't kill them but it
makes them come back
their riker isn't communicating with
them riker is having trouble
communicating with picard
it's this whole cycle of no one knowing
what anybody else is doing
but picard figures it out that's how you
communicate isn't it by
by citing example metaphor
and i think a lot with the language it's
it's nice because they take a lot of
time
for him to figure out he figures it out
but the people on the enterprise also do
too
rather quickly data and troy are going
through the data banks and they're like
what's
you know tanagra and they find you know
it's it's 12 different things
who's dharmak uh darmok is a beverage on
blah blah blah then they find two things
that connect
and they realize oh they're speaking in
metaphor they seem to communicate
through narrative imagery
a reference to the individuals and
places which appear in their
mytho-historical accounts
it's as if i were to say to you juliet
on her balcony
this is a meaning of love they we
understand that
uh someone else might not yeah but the
thing is
if the if the universal translator is
down
the darmox also have english words
thrown in there shaco when the walls
fell his eyes
open and it's like those are english
words uh
mixed in with your weird mis
mythical characters but it was all
gobbledygook
like if you said dharma globa
gelad wagga chanagra they'd be like
temba his arms wide when you gave me the
knife
and the fire timber his arms wide
so the point is is that this this this
alien race
that we don't understand they do things
very differently
and and picard takes the time to try to
understand as this the diplomat as he is
you know if it were kirk it'd be a whole
different story if it were kirk spock
would have done all the work
kirkwood said look mister i don't
understand you i'm going this way
and i'll see you in hell
spock would just be exasperated
obviously they're talking in metaphors
the sparks kirk be like what i'm going
to read them the constitution
maybe that will work i'll teach them our
values
timber his arm's wide tempura is a
person
his arm's wide because he's
he's holding them apart in
in generosity in giving
in taking but i i like the way they kind
of
they kind of take you through their
language and they make the audience
realize how they communicate bit by bit
the thing i loved re-watching this it
actually
brought this episode up a lot in my
opinion the episode opens up and they're
they're saying they're gibberish
dharmakat jalal
and you the enterprise crew and you the
audience watching it are like
what the fuck this is this is gibberish
i don't understand it and then
you get to the very end of the episode
where picard
gets onto the bridge just in time to
stop a battle from breaking out
and they're saying the same the exact
same gibberish
but me the audience i follow along with
what they're saying
perfectly because the entire episode
taught us
bit by bit what this means and this this
metaphor
means giving and this metaphor means
failure
and oh yeah accepting you know
his arms closed you know picard is
telling them that their captain died
when he said
chakra when the walls fell i understand
what they're saying
shakma won the wall
that's that's and and you know what's
kind of fun too
like i was thinking about star trek
discovery that that giant dumpster fire
and and and you know all your badass
characters and everything exploding and
torpedoes hitting the enterprise blowing
up and if people flying
you can have sword fights and
picard they finally get picard up and he
just
waltzes onto the bridge with this just
like this
attitude of like i get the fuck out of
my way i know what i'm doing
on screen he doesn't even like say hi to
anybody like
any and he just starts talking to him
right and they're like
uh yeah fists his arms closed guacamole
when the walls
fell and they're like okay okay and then
he said all the bridge lights go back on
and he's just like
that's the ultimate badass moment like
he comes back from the planet
and he unders he learned the goddamn
language himself
and he comes back and he just talks to
them on screen
and and calls the whole situation as
as the expert diplomat that he is and
and he's just like i'm i'm a fucking
badass
and i did it with language and
communication
by learning you know not by punching
that was one of the greatest picard
moments when he just
tells the the aliens in their own
language what happened
and and saves the day heroically told
them what happened
heroically told them what happened he
learned their language and uh
and yeah so yes you could argue about
the the alien language and does it
really make sense but
really in in short it's just
it's another first contact dish kind of
episode that
i i like that i like this episode a lot
more re-watching it now when i'm older
when i was younger the less exciting
things were happening when you're 12
you don't really care about the
subtleties and the the
i care less that their language is silly
now that i do
about the story they told about learning
to communicate with somebody
well said that's exactly my point is yes
the language is silly it doesn't quite
make sense in
in reality you know there's so many
things in star trek that don't make
sense
i i can't imagine an emergency on their
bridge
where somebody has to explain that
there's a warp core breach
and they need to transfer power from an
auxiliary system to stop it
efficiently i can't imagine how they do
that but
that's another thing though it
translates into our own lives where you
can look at other like human cultures on
the planet and go how can they
communicate like that
how did how do these people like do that
like it's
things that are foreign to us that
that are completely normal maybe they
can
really effectively communicate a
situation or or an emergency by using
metaphor
that that because they just know every
metaphor
in their entire culture in their brains
and it's
it's a concept that would be totally
bizarre
and foreign to us and impractical but to
them
that's their entire culture and and
and existence and they're really good at
it right
yeah and so and that's that's i think
was the point
is that you can look at a different
culture and go how the fuck do you
people communicate with each other like
that or how do you do that
and um until you learn it and understand
it
uh it's classic star trek classic
classic star trek and
that creature is no longer a threat to anybody because i own its fucking head
my my my next episode i
i know you're number one you called a
guilty pleasure
your your uh was the nth degree yeah
last time around
this is my guilty pleasure coming right
up
uh this is uh the next phase
which has no high-minded ideals
whatsoever this is just straight up
a fun episode fair enough
uh the the enterprise gets a distress
signal
from a a romulan vessel and so the
enterprise shows up and beams like riker
wharf
row and jordy over to help out
jordy eunice says we need to fix this
device we need to go back to the
enterprise and replicate it
so he and roe beam back over to the
enterprise with this weird romulan
device
and they they vanish they never
re-materialize
and uh the enterprise thinks they are
dead they think they got lost in
transport but as we find out after the
stinger when
when picard just walks right by an
unconscious
role aaron on the floor row
and jordy are both very much alive but
they are invisible
and intangible dr crusher i'm right here
damn it
and and ro thinks she's the ghost
story-wise there is there is a good
choice of the two characters
we're dead jordy is that some kind of a
joke
because you've got jordy laforge the
engineer science-minded
but my uniform my visor
are you saying i'm some blind ghost with
clothes
straight up technical guy and then roll
aaron the bajorans
religious in the bajorans they have
their culture yes you don't have geordi
and data or jordy and dr crusher where
they're both science
scientists and science-minded you got
opposite ends of the spectrum
and then they're both dealing with are
we in a are we in a
technological snafu or are we ghosts
well it's star trek so we know they're
at a technological snafu
yeah yeah through row we we toy with the
idea that they are
ghosts she's she has a character
who was kind of at odds with her own
culture you know
she's she's from a very spiritual people
but she row herself isn't always that
spiritual
but but now now that she's a ghost she's
like well geez maybe
maybe the old stories were right well i
i was thinking about what makes an
episode of guilty pleasure
and what makes it a quality episode and
i was
i was thinking about what some of my
guilty pleasures are
and i want to say it's
when the science is schlock
because one of my
uh guilty pleasures and or favorite
episodes which i didn't
include on this list because it's a
super guilty pleasure
um is called remember me with dr crusher
when wesley crusher is fucking around in engineering and creates some kind of warp bubble that dr crusher ends up inside
and that episode
starts off with her and there's like an
old man doctor that she's friends with
and he's i'm so old
and then he's the one who's the first
one who disappears and then people start
disappearing i'd like lieutenant wharf
to program onboard sensors to monitor
all personnel
if we can catch the moment or whom did
you say
wharf chief of security
the big guy who never smiles
and then i don't know what happens
how what universe she's in
it's not a delusion it is not a dream
there is a physical measurable
phenomenon at work here
pick up remember at the end everyone's
gone and it's just mccartney's like we
never needed a crew
we just needed me there are 114 people
on the enterprise
that is the exact number there should be
there are now over 900
missing she's like how do you explain
all the fucking rooms on this ship
and and who are these people who wh
where
are they in her head are they ghosts
what uni is she in an alternate universe
why are these people interacting with
her and why are they like covering this
up
what is the primary mission of the
starship enterprise
to explore the galaxy do i have the
necessary skills to complete that
mission alone
negative then why am i the only crew
member
makes no fucking sense at all but it's a
fun episode
it's collapsing all integrity now
compromised on decks three
through 15. i think i think because
everyone keeps disappearing and she
doesn't
she thinks she's crazy and then a
they keep trying to rescue her by this
this vortex that opens
they keep trying to suck her out of the
bubble and she's holding onto furniture
and stuff
but but scientifically it makes no sense
and that's the next phase as well it's a
little better
you could you could you could nitpick
the hell out of the next
phase there's there's no reason they
should even be able to breathe
let alone how the fuck do they stand on the floor
right i mean okay say say
because they can walk through walls we
establish they can walk straight through
walls
what is keeping them from falling to the
floor how does artificial gravity work
in star trek
that they should have had a throwaway
line where rose says well how why don't
we fall through the floors if we walk
through the walls well
the gravity plating must be must be
pushing up on our
anti-gravity fields on our molecule
semi-transparent molecules right
it's fine because it's all
in good fun it's an episode about
what would happen when you die
and how do the people you work with
and care about remember you i guess i
guess there is a little bit to that
because uh
data is tasked with planning their
funeral
right and uh data's data's going around
like ask ask a few people like what
would be an appropriate way to handle a
food roll and
i just wanted to say thank you
for trusting in me when no one else
would the bigger
part is roe and her character because
she
this takes place after um one of my
episodes conundrum
where her and riker have sex and so
there's always this like kind of thing
with them
and he's gonna do her eulogy and
and you know she's kind of like
listening and what is he going to say
you know
what is he going to say my eulogy and
she kind of like cares what
she you realize she cares what other
people think of her
even though she's this like i don't give a shit
about any of you people she's she's like
your
stubborn teenager commander ryker and i
have expectations
captain i know the routine
you don't have to worry about me we're
stuck with each other
so let's just get this over with as
quickly as possible and go our own
separate ways okay
like a like a brat almost a rebellious
rebellious teenager
who says i don't care
i don't
fuck you
i'm gonna do it my way
my way is better because it's my way
this is not a bright idea i beg your
pardon ensign
i didn't quite catch that nothing
sir and then when she's dead she really
cares about what picard thought of her
what riker thought of her
people that she thought she was at odds
with
majority there's not much going on there
yeah but it's more so about roe cause i
think they're
well jordy is there more than the
counterpoint to the spiritual
journey that roe is going on where he's
like we're gonna i'm no we're not dead
i'm gonna find out what happened to us
we're gonna reverse him
yeah he's the anchor to reality it's
more
of a row episode and i think there's a
scene on the shuttle craft
where um there is data and
warfare flying around the shuttle craft
and they're taking the shuttle craft
back and forth
yeah because they're terrified of the
transporters right now until they can
really do a diagnostic
because they think the transporter just
killed two people right and and data's
asking about like the bajoran death
ritual or something and we're like oh
god it's 15 hours long and
she says that well that's where was like
look i'm a fucking klingon
i'm the wrong person to ask about planning a funeral
i'm very happy for them right because
they died with honor
right right yeah and so it's it's a
little bit about
death life how you're perceived by other
people
they have the funeral which is like a
party kind of thing
that's why that's why i say this is more
this episode is more for
fun because data's funeral involves a
ragtime
band yeah like it's it's i'm not gonna
say it's played for comedy but
it's played for fun yeah because they're
walking around
they have to spread around like neutrino
particles or something like that well
they figure out that when they face
through things that that
that creates the the the chronotonic
field or whatever
kind of ghosting particles that might
lead data to the solution that they are
not dead
because there is a there is a ticking
clock element there's
here's the thing because the romulans
well one of the you know the twist is
the romulan ship
is been been playing around with this
experimental
phased cloak which that comes up again
later in season seven
but they're they're working on this new
tech that will let you be cloaked
invisible and intangible which
that's some that's some that's some dangerous shit
the romulans are worried that the
federation is going to find out they're
working on this
so they sabotage the enterprise's
engines
is that the philadelphia experiment oh
yeah a little bit
yeah uh and if the enterprise goes into
warp the enterprise will blow up
and because row and uh jordy are face
cloaked
they overhear this and the ticking clock
is
oh shit
we need to find a way to warn the enterprise
before they go into warp yeah yeah not
to turn on their warp engine
and and there is also unbeknownst to
them
a romulan who is fazed cloak
and you have my favorite scene in this
where there's a a chase scene where this
romulan is like hunting down
row
and they're just running through like
crew members quarters and they're having
this dramatic life or death struggle
while like like people are just like
getting ready to go to bed
dudes dudes working out and like roe
runs through him
yeah and um they're having having this
crazy
fight while date is just like having a
conversation with somebody and if you're
seeing any fields
play slow conversation while there's a
struggle going on
excuse me lieutenant row i'm detecting a
chromatin field
it's uh it's played out at the end too
when they have to
they realize that shooting like the
romulan phasers around
that that increases the the field that
that data can scan because they're
trying to get data's attention
through these fields they can create but
you have the shot where everyone's
partying and they're just casually
walking around shooting faces
well this is unusual yeah
well row is frustrated because she's
never gonna she knows now that she's
never gonna hear what riker has to say
about her at her funeral
and so in just frustration she shoots
him in the head with the romulan
disrupter
i i do have one moment i want to point
out early on in this episode
uh somebody says yes to wharf for
probably the first time
ever uh worf
is always used to make
like negative suggestions like
this tr wharf is like like mistrustful
like we have to shoot first
then why do we wait if we attack the
ship now they will not be able to
maintain their scattering field
we we run into these aliens we don't
know much about them and wharf is always
the one who suggests
we should load up the photon photon
torpedoes and blow them out of the sky
and he does that so that captain picard
could say no
i'm really diplomatic and look how good
i am he makes captain picard look better
when captain picard
always shoots down warf's violence
recommend we go to yellow alert sir
why and in this episode
wharf makes a suggestion that look the
romulans need our computers
i don't think we should give them our
computers the romulans want a computer
we cannot give them access to federation
technology that is an
unacceptable security risk and riker is
like oh yeah that's a good idea yeah now
let's let's just give them something old
what about a computer core from 30 or 40
years ago one the romulans are already
familiar with
that would be satisfactory and wharf is
so used to people just shutting him down
that he actually he actually thanks
ryker for listening to him
hi sir
thank you and that moment made me smile
it's interesting this uh next phase
episode is very similar
to another episode which is my next
episode
it's called
