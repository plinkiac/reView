Well, Jay, welcome to another episode of re:View.
We're back, baby.
We're back.
I can see the poster case is empty.
Oh.
Which means we don't know what we're gonna talk about.
I suppose the title of the video gives it away, but, what should we talk about, Jay?
What's going on?
Oh, my god.
Mike, did you steal fizzy lifting drinks?
Of course I did.
we're gonna have to pass tons of gas to get out of this situation.
Where's Rich Evans when you need him?
So, Jay, what movie are we talking about today on re:View?
Crash, directed by David Cronenberg?
No, I was thinking more like Willy Wonka.
so jay we're here to talk about
one of my favorite films of all time
willy wonka on the chocolate factory i
think that might surprise some people
that's one of your favorite movies i
love it to this day
yes I i watched it maybe five million
times as a kid it's one of those movies
where I know
every single line of dialogue and every
single little moment has
some kind of memory in my head even down
to the
the opening credits oh yeah when it says
the titles when it says producer david l
walpner and I used to think they were
saying whopper
like those malted covered malt milk and
bluff balls when I was a little kid
all the credits were going to be like a
candy pun yeah I didn't know
what credits were watching it and I was
like whopper
they're just listening they're just
listing off candies my favorite candy is
is a gene wilder a lovely man gene
wilder oh yeah
born in milwaukee wisconsin that's true
that's true one of the
few celebrities from this area
mark ruffalo from kenosha liberace one
of the most
glamorous and fanciful men who ever
lived came out of the dirtiest
nastiest city in the world west allis
is west dallas where the the walker inn
drag or out pub is is that west a lot of
the
actors in this are british well that's
that's what I'd in rewatching it because
i watched this a ton as a kid too but i
haven't seen it in a long time and so
re-watching it I was like this feels
very
the humor feels very british but it
turns out it's
not really there's some british actors
in it but uh
director is american and it was shot in
germany right
but it has a very sort of that kind of
dry british humor too
a lot of that comes from the school
teacher I've just decided to switch
our friday schedule to monday which
means that the tests we take each friday
on what we learned during the week will
now take place on monday before we've
learned it
and uh uh of rook salt's father
sweetheart I can't push him no harder 19
000 bars an hour they're shelling
before we get into it uh the
willy wonka chocolate factory is a
lightning in the bottle situation
it's a it's a star wars kind of movie
because
it's an anomaly in many many ways
and I think that's why it fascinates me
so much because
we're talking about director mel stewart
primarily came from documentaries
if you look at his imdb page yeah I was
like what else has he done and it's all
like tv stuff documentary film and and
we'll talk about that when we break down
some of the scenes in this movie how it
has
almost a documentary feel a lot of the
vignettes
a lot of the sequences um feel very like
slice of life almost which is
heavily contrasted in the terrible tim
burton movie
which we're going to delve into a little
bit like the story behind the movie
uh I mean this movie's almost 50 years
old now
1971 I think this is a good example of
uh when people say like oh and old kids
don't like old movies
it's like it's a good movie it holds up
as a little kid I loved this it was
before my time
i loved wizard of oz before my time and
those movies still hold up for kids
today
yeah a kid would kids will like this
movie more than the Johnny Depp one
oh I think so what and even even
with the fact that 60
of this movie is prior to them going
into the chocolate factory yeah and i
will say as a kid that was the stuff
i I didn't dislike it but I just it was
a when are they gonna
get to the fireworks factory situation
and now in re-watching it
that's like where a lot of the best
stuff is as far as the comedy goes
yeah well well that's another thing is
it works for adults and children
it's your husband's life or your case of
wonka bars
how long will they give me to think it
over and I even liked the stuff until
they got to the chocolate factory
there's
only one part that I didn't like that
department everyone fast forwards
through yeah
part that I run fast forwards through
and that's uh charlie's mother's song
you get blue like everyone
but not just that song but the whole
scene where he goes and visits her
now I like that scene I just don't care
about that song all the other songs are
great yeah
but it's a weird scene too because she's
like telling him to
to not have dreams it's very bizarre
there are a hundred billion people in
this world and only five of them will
find golden tickets
even if you had a sack full of money you
probably wouldn't find one
and after this contest is over you'll be
no different from the billions of others
who didn't find one
but uh so 1971 the movie
had a budget of two million dollars
uh which was you know even low for even
for 1971.
we're dealing with 2 million dollars
today the picture would probably cost
80 million everything we had to do
close to the vest watch the bucks for a
movie of this scale
yeah um with with the big sets and all
the costumes and
props and stuff um it was produced by
quaker oats
is it that's true yeah know um cause
uh I think the director's daughter read
the book and was like daddy
this is a great movie this would make a
great movie make it I don't know okay
and then somebody heard that quaker oats
wanted to
was going to release a new chocolate bar
and then they're like hey wait a minute
my daughter just read this book
let's make a movie as a tie-in and we'll
call them wonka bars
and quake rhodes was like oh okay and so
the movie
was made as basically a co-advertisement
for the release of chocolate bar and
then it's very ahead of its time in
terms of
uh cramming in product placement movies
are nothing but an advertisement it was
a product
placement movie and then when they made
the chocolate bars
they screwed up the formula and when the
chocolate bars
were in room temperature they would melt
when chocolate bars are supposed to sit
on store shelves and they melt in the
heat but not in the store
and so they had to recall all of them
then the movie came out and there were
no chocolate bars
so the movie wasn't like a big hit at
first right no no which is really
surprising because now it's a
you know everybody it's a smoothie it's
one of those things where it was
kind of a small budget it was slapped
together
but we really were a bunch of amateurs
flying by the seat of our pants
and I think that I think the film
reflects that
it has that kind of energy that kind of
ingenuity
uh the director was a guy who did
documentaries
and not kids films and that has it has
this really dry
sense of humor and it's very dark yes
and and
kind of disturbing at parts it's a
classic
kids fairy tale they started shooting
the movie
it's roll doll is credited as the
screenwriter
but there's a different guy who like
punched it up and changed stuff and then
you know it's like one of those things
where at some point someone says well
let's do a song
handyman with lava makes the world
taste good I think
there was talks of sammy davis jr doing
the candyman song and coming in and
doing the part for it
and then they're like no we don't want
someone famous we went to some nobody
and oh let's have songs
and then they're like okay these two
guys
write write a bunch of songs well we
don't have the script eh just it's about
this chocolate factory
and then they're like okay and they just
yeah it's a couple songs and
the music by tony newley and leslie
brickes had been completed before the
screenplay was
and so they started building the sets
and in fact in munich started
filming the musical sequences I know the
original book had
the oompa loompas sing they probably do
um and they ported over the lyrics from
their songs for the Johnny Depp version
which is surprising because those songs
are fucking awful well
but the lyrics from for that are
directly from the original book see i
haven't read the book
um so uh I am not that familiar
with the source material yeah um charlie
and the chocolate factory and then
there's
the great class elevator class elevator
yeah I read a lot I went through a roald
dahl phase in like fifth grade where i
read that like those and the witches
oh okay well great you could provide
some insight well I haven't read them
since fifth grade
i don't remember a single thing okay
that was just five years ago
we said give us three or four songs an
umba song
and a main theme and a couple of other
things
but yeah they're like we don't have uh
dialogue to lead us into these songs
i don't know what's going on and then
and then oh the
the writer like was like I'm done
filming the movie I'm going to my cabin
in maine
you can't reach me only by pay phone in
the woods
and they're like we don't have the
ending of the script says grandpa joe
yells yippee
and then mel stewart said I can't have
my fucking movie you end with grandpa
yelling yippee
call the writer and he's like uh how
about
uh don't forget what happened to the man
who suddenly got everything he always
wanted
what happened he lived happily ever
after
that's it shoot it the whole the whole
crew's waiting there
and then this is all news to me I  I didn't
know yeah yeah there's always
what
i didn't watch the comment the
commentary on the blu-ray had all the
kids
i started listening to it and I said no
I'm like no I don't care what any of
these
these twerps have to say yeah so so it's
that kind of like
you don't have this big glossy huge
production
you have it's not over thought and it's
definitely not like committee thinking
yes they're flying by the seat of their
pants
yeah and so it's like uh well let's
shoot in germany
um we wanted to make it look like it
doesn't take place in any specific
place not in america just any town in
any any town in the world that could
take place and everyone thinks it's
england because there's
actors with british accents because they
had to to bring in
uh actors you know they pulled augustus
group out of a sewer
there this is fat kid we found him at a
store
he doesn't speak any english you know so
they I think they just fed him his lines
you know he doesn't have too many yeah
the mother of course
i don't know if she was doing a german
accent or if she was german but
the oompa loompas uh they they couldn't
find any
they couldn't find any little people in
germany
they found like one and you didn't speak
english so they import some from turkey
and they're like and none of them spoke
english so they're just like yeah
carried a big sack of sugar
you can kind of now that you mentioned
that you can kind of tell in some of the
background ones there's a couple like
star oompa loompas
that get a lot of screen time but if you
look at the ones towards the edge of the
frame
there's like confused elderly oompa
loompas yeah they don't look like they
quite know what's happening
little people were in short supply in
1971 in germany
the most memorable stuff from the movie
is the music
and the songs they're so simple and
memorable and catchy
timeless timeless and then you can just
like the the tim burton version
right timeless
imagination
well the best creative decision and
maybe you know how he came about being
in it but
casting gene wilder is willy wonka
that's like like perfectly cast because
gene wilder
is one of the greats and and his
performance in this is so
pitch perfect yeah in terms of every
line he says
could be interpreted as either
completely sincere
possible my dear lady that's absurd
unthinkable why
because that pipe doesn't go to the
marshmallow room go to the fudge room or
total sarcasm
how do you make them I'm a trifle deaf
in this year speak a little louder next
time
and you're never sure which it is right
and he he he is perfect at that
a lovely man his interviews he's just so
sweet and kind and thoughtful and
he said that he's like yeah uh okay
I'll do this film but I want to come out
with a cane
when I come out of the factory oh yeah
that's his idea I heard that and they're
like oh
yeah whatever I mean he's like my reason
was because
when I do the cane trick at that point
after that you don't
know when I'm telling the truth or if
I'm bullshitting or whatnot
that was his entire reasoning for doing
the movie was like if I can do that
then then I'll do the film it'll set the
stage for his character and
and that's the thing too is like
comparing him and Johnny Depp
oh my god it's just
Johnny Depp is atrocious in that remake
i couldn't even
finish it it's it's bizarre because the
tim burton Johnny Depp
collabs they're usually like great
together I mean obviously we've talked
about ed wood
but man whoever had if it was tim burton
or Johnny Depp's decision to play that
character
that way my initial idea was
i kept seeing like a game show host you
know like a bad game show host in a way
bravo well done that led me to
the idea of like a children's show host
tim and I got together we were talking
about and it's like
really great thing is a local children's
show host
a guy who certainly puts on a face
he's sort of like a mix of like michael
jackson
and like a crazy person and he
has like an open disdain for the
children yeah which is weird
like that's the great thing about the uh
i almost called them gene simmons
gene wilder performance maybe they
should cast gene simmons
in the remake that anyone would have
been better than anyone but but yeah
that that you never know
how he's looking at these kids in the
the gene wilder version yeah
he's enigmatic and that's how wonka
should be not eccentric
he is eccentric by nature but
i think those two big words that start
with e
maybe Johnny Depp doesn't know the
difference between them
it's a very interesting interpretation
that Johnny Depp is giving it
and it's pure it's somewhat childlike
but it's
it's deep and it's it's vulnerable i
always thought of veruca was the type of
wart you got on the bottom of your foot
yeah have you ever seen the show kidding
with jim carrey
no he plays like a uh
fred rogers-esque kind of tv children's
show
host yeah and he's very bizarre and over
the top
when he's on his show it reminds his
depths performance reminded me of that
like jim carrey
yeah like I'm gonna be crazy oh
she's frustrated because her rocket ship
keeps falling over
i think her band boosters from his
firing the idea of like a children's
show host tim and I got to get on we
were talking about and it's like
really great thing is a local children's
show host
a guy who certainly puts on a face
and I  I had like a little moment of
realization
watching the wonka movie the tim burton
one
the tim burton one was that moment when
they finally get
let into the factory right
and then the doors open and uh there's
this weird like display of like these
little marionettes and it's like willy
wonka
monica earworm song yeah yes and um all
they have this wide shot of all the kids
and their parents standing there staring
at this
crazy display and it starts on fire and
all this stuff and I was like
that would have been really impactful or
fascinating
if everything before that was just
straight
as an arrow yes and and they opened the
doors and it's just like this
fucked up weird nightmare world um
but everything outside looks exactly
like that their lives
completely normal but tim burton just
couldn't resist
well that's yeah you compare look at uh
the the bucket household in
the gene wilder movie versus how it
looks in the tim burton movie
it's it's almost like the tim burton
style is so
exaggerated it's just like it's all
german expressionism and weird
distorted angles and no you know
straight edges and it's it's so abstract
that it
is weird to see actual humans on it like
it looks like it should be his little
like stop-motion figures or yeah it
looks like you put real people on that
set it looks completely
incongruous yeah but you look at the
their little house
in the original movie and it's like
perfect it's very grounded it's very
real
yeah and and the way they introduce all
the kids as they would
get the golden tickets it's like that
that tim burton style where it's like
the
the the exaggeration of the we'll talk
about the salt family
oh yeah you know they're the rich family
um and so they have these like these
really
wide shots and their palatial estate and
the father's there and
you know you know and it's so like
so cartoony and over-exaggerated and you
need that contrast of
real world and wonka world yes and tim
burn just couldn't resist
being tim burton and I think of like
how they introduced all the characters
in the 1971 film
like it it it does feel like
documentary like they're they're filming
in the office of
of the salt peanut factory and the
mother's knitting and the father's just
complaining and
he's yelling out and all of his
employees opening up the candy bar
yeah and then the news is going around
like when they're
interviewing augustus gloop or mike tv
it's done through the lens of like the
media and it feels like you're in
somebody's house and they're
documentary there's no style from the
filmmaker it's just
it's just look it looks like the media
and it's how charlie is seeing
everything
yeah he's not getting this warped uh
artistic
stylized view of things he's just seeing
this on the news
well that's yeah and that's something
that the original movie really builds up
well is the uh
the the worldwide frenzy the hysteria
that is built up around
everybody looking for these golden
tickets and that's really kind of
missing from the tim burton one
it happens very quickly it's very quick
but it's it's such a big part of the
first half of the uh of the original
movie
all the all the little vignettes and
that's something I appreciate now more
than I did when I was a kid
but I dreamed the archangel appeared and
whispered into my ear
and told me where to find a golden wonka
ticket and what exactly did you say
or what difference does that make this
was a dream a fantasy
i mean you said just offsetter and tell
me where the ticket is all these little
just one scene moments of random people
the best being the woman whose husband
has been kidnapped and they're asking
about a ransom
such a and it's just delivered
completely straight I'll give them
anything
anything they want all I want is to have
harold back
they want your case of wonka bars
it's just it's it's it's
magnificent
and also in the the uh gene wilder one
is
he's so mysterious willy wonka is so
mysterious you see
charlie looking outside his factory and
they get that that creepy guy with the
cart of
knives I guess he's selling knives
nobody ever comes out
yeah and it builds up this mystique to
uh to the character but
you see him almost right off the bat the
tim burton one you see all these little
stories with him yeah you see grandpa
joe used to work at his factory which
doesn't build to anything
there's no point to that no um yeah it
really builds up which is why I think as
a kid I wanted to get there
because you you want to see the factory
as an adult you appreciate the slow burn
exactly because you don't realize when
you're a little kid that it's building
and I also think the the way the tim
burton one portrayed
charlie's poverty was also
either underdone or I'm
misleading or cartoony or whatever
because in in
the original version it's many things
that make you root for charlie
starting right off the bat with his
introduction which is all the kids in
the candy store
and apparently the candy man just lets
them go wild
i guess maybe bills their parents later
there wasn't really a reason charlie
couldn't
participate in that but that's true he's
just kind of throwing shit around yeah
it's a wonderful song
and it's a wonderful little sequence
that that
shares the joy of of of childhood and
candy and charlie is outside the window
because he either can't participate or
feels
like an outsider very clearly done
almost
cinematically done but uh yeah he goes
home and you know
like you said his house is realistic uh
the
the four grandparents in the bed the
poor mother the father's not in the
picture
i don't know if that's the way in the
book yeah I  I don't remember I know he's
in the
yeah in the tim burton movie but uh he
either either eating cabbage soup
they're poor charlie's birthday's coming
up he's got the paper out
he buys a piece of bread a loaf of bread
it makes everybody happy and then
there's the embarrassing
scene in the classroom oh yeah the
teacher's asking how many wonka bars
everybody's bought
yes and that's also a nice little check
mark for charlie he chose
he chooses not to lie and so and that's
the big arc of his character is
is he he doesn't say well yeah 10 wonka
bars he
he's just two you know charlie bucket
how many did you open
two two what do you mean you only opened
two
uh he he doesn't say 20 or he could have
lied
but he doesn't because charlie is pure
of hearts uh there is a lack of
villains in this movie and in my opinion
the villain is grandpa joe
how about this charlie where'd you get
that what difference does it make where
he got it point is he got it
even though there's a fake villain
there's slugworth slugworth
slugworth also was they had no idea what
slugworth was
they're like we need a scene where
there's a bad guy oh really and it's
like at the end they're like
oh okay let's figure it out if i
remember correctly there was no villain
it didn't have slugworth that was an
invention by one of us or all of us
along the way
that there was this guy whispering in
everybody's ear as they went
i don't think I was sure what he was
whispering until
i got down toward the end of it you know
i had to make good on that promise of
slugworth
I'm not sure if that was somebody else's
idea or mine
we should probably explain why he is at
all these kids uh
uh location exactly when they get the
golden ticket
yeah that's true that's true too
although that doesn't really make sense
because how would you know who's going
to get the golden ticket but
it's a good little mystery it's a good
setup and it has a payoff at the end
it's and it's scary too you know it's
really creepy looking slugworth is going
to come around and whisper something
into your ear
i congratulate you little boy well done
i have to assume that actor was german
didn't
didn't speak any english probably yeah
but yeah slugworth whispers into their
ear I'll give you a whole bunch of cash
if you steal a
uh neverland stopper grandpa joe
because willy wonka is not the villain
uh
there is no clear villain slugworth is
kind of set up to be
a villain in my opinion grandpa joe is
and
i think it's not his
that money was for fault I told you
charlie I've given it up
he he says uh you know no that's for
your tobacco
you know you like that um and then
charlie finds money in the street he's
rewarded for his
his good karma but um the second charlie
comes home with that golden ticket
grandpa suddenly can walk and
he starts singing a song about how he's
got a golden ticket
oh cause I've got a golden ticket
I've got a golden tweet I never thought
my life would be anything but
catastrophe so um
and it's then it's I've got a golden
ticket
it's not really his fault I think they
gave
the songwriters a memo and said write a
song about how you found a golden ticket
we said give us three or four songs an
oompa loompa song
and a main theme and a couple of other
things
i guess if they didn't know what the
plot of the movie is
who sings this not charlie
so you're saying he's the villain
because he's he's kind of even though
charlie has won the golden ticket
grandpa jones
grabs it's mine now and charlie takes
him to the chocolate factory
he's the funner grandparent uh his
mother is his
poor mother just cooks and does laundry
and charlie you're boring I'm going with
grandpa grandpa's fun
and uh now that he can walk apparently
grandpa's always asking what's in it for
him
even at the very end so the factory's
yours charlie you can move in
immediately
and me it well in the great glass
wonkavader
he's like what about me you know
and then also at the end he's like come
on charlie let's go have a talk with mr
slugworth
I'll get even with him if it's the last
thing I ever do swagworth wants a
gobstopper he'll get one
after wonka chews him out he's like
let's go sell that so grandpa is awful
he's a little devil on charlie's
shoulder he is he is
he's the I think well not a bad person
he's
what he embodies the cynicism of adults
oh sure little boy's got to have
something in this world
to hope for what's he got to hope for
now
charlie's still pure charlie has not
been corrupted by anyone yet
right um so it's good grandpa joe's a
good character
he has a character as opposed to the the
tim burton movie
he used to work at the factory okay
when they get to the factory like you
kind of just forget he's even there he
has like no personality he has nothing
to do he doesn't
participate in the plot at all yeah
that's why that fizzy lifting drink
scene is is actually important
because it shows that charlie you know
it still has kind of outside
uh help being corrupted or something and
grandpa joe is fucking nothing in the
tim burton movie
the movie's not afraid to portray
children is awful
yeah which is great in a realistic way
but it might have some messy results
look at me I'm gonna be the first person
in the world to be sent by television
hey get away from that thing stop don't
come back except for maybe varuk
they push assault which is great because
it's just her that's that way
if all the kids were that exaggerated
yeah yeah then you get the tim burton
movie but in that one jab baruch assault
being so
snotty is one of the best things in the
movie she's a standout
character and her song is great yes and
um
you know she's a bratty kid mike tv he's
just
he doesn't care about anything but tv
about violet beauregard
who just passed away recently oh um
denise
nickerson I think's her name you know
she's just kind of like
vapid yeah and and a little bratty
and uh competitive and then
augustus gloop of course is a glutton
how do you feel
hungry hungry
all those little moments the reporter
with the deer antlers
coming out of his sides perfect comedy
framing so
flat so dry
and it's it's not it's not begging you
to
to laugh it's not showing itself off
well even the magical world of the
factory that you know they go into the
the the the main room where where willy
wonka's first song is and it's so
colorful and bright and everything's
edible
that's like the only big set in the
movie that has that kind of big bright
colorful
i think when people think of this movie
that's what they think of but every
other like the next room they go to
well first there's the boat scene which
we can talk about but the next room they
go to is just like that
the dump dumpy like factory room
the that main room is the only big
magical room and then it's like
it's almost like he's uh willy wonka's
putting on this illusion that this is
the factory but it's really just
that one kind of entrance into the uh
the rest of the factory
i think it's all just a front all those
rooms the real factory somewhere hidden
oh they just make chocolate and all
those rooms are just
a test kid just to fuck with him yeah i
mean because that is the ultimate point
of the movie is he's
trying to find the perfect kid to take
over the factory so
he's well aware that most of these kids
will be awful
what would happen if they were all awful
then would you would he have to do this
again
well that's why I was so frustrated at
the end that's true yeah he didn't think
charlie was up to the task
in his uh office where everything is is
cut in half
even even down to his magnifying glass
he's reading the half a contract with a
half a magnifying glass
why that little touch I don't know so
he's he's half he's
half in the real world half in the
fantasy world
i don't know but yeah he he he lets him
have it he yells at charlie
because uh charlie stole busy lifting
drinks
and the ceiling has to be washed and
sanitized
um and so he was very very upset
yeah but then charlie even though he
gets kicked out and denied his lifetime
supply of chocolate
he still gives him back that does the
right thing yes
so shines a good deed in a weary world
and and the reveal of that big atrium
room in the first one is just perfectly
done
it's built up where they get they go
through those little the
the tiny hallways they keep getting
smaller and he's got to put the
look and then but but that music it's
like
little little music and then and then
they all walk in
you know and then for the actors they
said it was the first time they seen the
set
they kept them away from the set to get
real reactions and in
the depth version I i don't I don't
remember
everything's janky and weird looking and
yeah it's the tim burton style but the
the reveal of the room seemed very like
not built up yeah I say same with
fucking when charlie
opens up and finds the golden ticket
it's like it's like that
they earned that movement in that moment
in the original version yes it was an
earned moment and it was
it was so built up
and exciting and and this is just like i
think they cut away and then
they cut to it and it's already open and
you already see it it's something weird
yeah and it's like oh my god that
editing was so
so poorly done and then you know the
original is peeling it back
run charlie run go straight home don't
stop till you get there
that's it that's it it's all over the
wonka contest is all over
the fifth and final ticket has been
found well you have your low point where
they think that the
the final ticket has already been found
it's a fake
yeah and so he buys a piece of candy for
himself but then he buys another one for
grandpa joe so it's his
his selflessness his selflessness is
what's
uh what rewards him
yeah yes you're right right it's all
perfectly built up
yes yes tell our little guy
this movie falls on the very short list
of mainstream movies that
kill an animal on screen which is pretty
fucked up it's like this an apocalypse
now
yeah that's not the only way the two
movies are similar
yeah I love the boat sequence
i mean visually it's terrible
oh it's great technically you know
they're just on a
rear screen projection you get no
impression that they're actually moving
in anything but
it's it has a surreal it's interesting
because this is what what 1971
it's still there's still that that kind
of bleed over from the 60s because it's
very psychedelic
yeah yeah but yeah the
the close-ups of of gene wilder with the
lights flashing back and forth
yes it's uh yeah it's it's a it's a
nightmare
yeah you don't know if willy wonka is a
bad guy
there's no earthly way of knowing
he's singing which direction we are
going
it's it's a it's a tonal whiplash from
that last scene
yeah wonka is trying to terrify them or
brainwash
them and we don't know and gene we don't
know because gene wilder doesn't let
anybody know yeah you can't possibly see
where you're going wonka
you're right I can't that's that is the
one seed I  I was saying earlier how it's
like you're never sure if he's being
sincere or cynical but obviously that
scene
he looks like an insane person but
that's intentional that's to throw
everybody off guard you don't know what
he's up to
and that's part of the ride and and
there's a there's a wonderful marilyn
manson video
oh yeah
and so marilyn manson's willy wonka and
then there's little there's there's
oompa loompas
you know they kind of recreate the scene
it's terrible like green screen effect
it's a very dated video so if if if that
particular sequence profoundly
emotionally affected someone like
marilyn manson you know there's
something
twisted about it and the chicken getting
its head cut off the weird bugs
like it's just so out of place
that it works yeah speaking of other dry
humor there's the contract scene
the often forgotten contracts oh yeah
little surprises around every corner but
nothing dangerous the big contract where
the
the font slowly gets like so small you
can't read it
oh I'm not signing that you know
lickable wallpaper
for nursery walls lickable wallpaper
like an orange taste looks like an
orange
the snozberries taste like snozberries
snowsperry
who ever heard of a snozzberry and he
grabs her fucking face
it says my dear we music makers are the
music makers
we are the dreamers of the dreams i.e
shut up
that's what he would say in the uh the
Johnny Depp version instead of anything
like
interesting or magical shut up
you're really weird
that was the most disappointing thing in
that remake because danny elfman
you know collaborated with tim burton a
lot done some great scores
and was the lead singer of one of my
favorite bands owing
to boingo so I was excited to hear oompa
loompa oingo boingo sounding songs
can I just let you in in a little secret
jenny lingo blingo sucks
oingo bunga was wonderful oinko oingo
boingo
are uh how many songs by owen go boingo
do you even know
exactly
I'm the only expert I can comment on his
horrible oompa loompa
sure but but you know like uh I don't
know
the rolling stones are a great band can
they write oompa loompa songs
you know what I mean no tim burt our
danny elfman's style
to me felt appropriate
instead of doing anything that would
sound like it would
fit into that world he did this weird
like every song is like a different
style of music like there's a rock song
there's like a suit that's something
that says committee thinking that that
to me that
maybe maybe it like if it was danny
elfman's idea it was a horrible decision
i don't know
but of course we must admit originally i
thought all four of the songs
would be based on the first one it goes
no no
now and
do something like crazy
rock and this would be like queen it
should be like
you're nuts all right what the heck I'll
do it
no the oompa loompa song you get it uh
four times four deaths mm-hmm outside of
charlie I like that they all
have a similar they're not all similar
and and and they're all
little very easy to understand lessons
and then of course you have
you have charlie's song which is a fine
song it just sucks
I've got a golden ticket song um and
then the big one pure imagination
simply look around and view it like it's
very like
very old theatrical old musical
it it feels very like 1940s
50s kind of like musical sure
i I it's 70s they could have very easily
gone like
gross like funk or disco or something
like you said psychedelic had its kind
of influences
but it it feels very like classical yeah
like well it makes the movie feel
timeless
it makes it feel tired it was the tim
burton one where you have all the oompa
loompas like playing electric guitars
it's just got awful yeah and it's and
it's it's and you can't hear what
they're saying
and it's just so noisy and sick
and gross
and just off-putting it's just it's just
an endless
list of bad decisions yeah with that
remake
starting with making it really maybe
with a different director
i mean tim burton especially at that
point is like okay we're over this
the tim burton style is now like uh it
feels like a
like he's on autopilot which led to the
i think it was the movie after this is
that when he did his alice in wonderland
which I i maintain is the ugliest movie
I've ever seen
visually yeah I mean there was a good
20 years where tim burton would just
remake stuff
because he's still doing it he did dumbo
recently
he's still at it yeah well it's that
lack of
like we're talking about with the
original movie how you have the contrast
of the real world with
the factory world and you look at like
beetlejuice or something
that's very real until you get to the
afterlife worlds and
maybe 80s tim burton would have been
able to make a good willy wonka movie
peewee's big adventure I i think it's
it's a little mixture of vanity ego I'm
the genius
master tim burton of my visual style
blah blah and then it's like budget too
it's just like here's 100 million
dollars to make a willy wonka movie
go crazy yeah people love
my visual style and it's like
that's not what made the the first movie
worked because the songs are simple
charlie's likable charlie's likable it's
a nice little
children's fairy tale story willy wonka
the performance by gene wilder
is iconic perfect pitch
perfect in terms of its tone and it's
inventive
with a relatively low budget weird
things that you don't see like the hand
coat hangers the gags
with the big contract on the wall the
the wonka bubble machine
oh yeah the mic tv scene when he gets
shrunken down
and it's it's not over the top visual
effects
and and the boat scene there's there's
so many even in that small time frame
when they're in the
the goose the geese sorry
that lay the golden eggs and the the the
oompa loompas are packaging them up
um and vrookasaw goes nuts because she
wants
everything well and just the look of the
oompa loompas too
relatively simple just put some orange
makeup on him give him a little track
suit those goofy little pants
yep oh god in that scene where he
discovers the oompa loompas
oh and the tim burton one yeah
extraneous well that's you have a
gene wilder talking about how he rescued
him all from um
you don't know if he's lying or not you
don't know if he's lying or not for one
thing but then he's describing like the
vicious canids and all these like smiles
yeah all these creatures and it's just
completely left to your imagination
and yeah you don't know if he's just
making this all up and then
tim burton we see oompa loompa lance i
know it's real he's running around
a vicious canid is just a giant bug it's
so
for all its big visuals it feels so
uncreative
yeah and and unnecessary oh yeah it's
it's the mystery
that's that's key to to the willy wonka
magic
to the character yeah yeah and the
character mr wonka
they won't really be burned in the
furnace will they hmm
well I think that furnace is lit only
every other day so they have a good
sporting chance haven't they
stop don't stop don't come back now
please stop
don't come back I love that he starts
getting so bored
with the children like disobeying him
yeah now he's gotten used to it
what's the part where he's like uh call
for help is that what
he's like help help oh yeah yeah it's
when augustus gloop is being sucked yeah
okay that's right
do something hell police
murder yeah I think what what
the best comparison between and we're
not here just to shit on the tim burton
one
obviously it was a misfire we're here to
praise
the original it's a good example of
comparing it to the original what works
and what does yeah
it highlights it highlights the great
greatness of the first one and it
highlights the flaws
of of poor decisions with the new one
and why it was
just all around uh a bad movie and it
was going to give willy wonka a back
story
his daddy issues it it was
tim burton willy wonka was so bad and
traumatizing that
charlie grew up to be norman bates
i mean jesus christ
i think the first thing I i couldn't
finish watching the remake I had to say
that's fair
it just everything about it is just so
bad
it's just it's not just bad it's
obnoxious I'm terribly sorry
it's obnoxious Johnny Depp's performance
is obnoxious and it's just oh god i
i I don't know what year gene wilder
died but I i hope he never saw that film
even if he wasn't live when it came out
he probably still didn't bother to see
it
well if he was invited to the premiere
oh god how embarrassing I know and i
think he died somewhat recently
within the last five years yeah yeah so
i think yeah he probably was alive
if he just said no no thank you I won't
be attending
yeah he just went back to knitting or
whatever he did in retirement
I just hope he never saw it because I just picture a single tear rolling down his eye, going, this is, this is the world--
But we appreciate Gene Wilder's performance.
It will live on far beyond Johnny Depp's awful and embarrassing and sickening, self-indulgent, disgusting, disturbing, vain, pointless and awful performance as Willy Wonka.
But in re-watching this film, and I didn't even need to re-watch the old one, the old one opens with beautiful footage of actual chocolate factory operations.
Mm-hmm.
And, boy, oh, boy, does that whet your whistle for chocolaty goodness.
Oh, sure. 
Sure.
Seeing the Hershey kisses being made and all the fudge and all the things being mixed around, and it's all real.
And you watch the Johnny Depp one...
Yeah, it's the cold, stark, bad-looking CGI chocolate that--
And then this warm, wonderful, documentary-looking footage...
Inviting.
Inviting, chocolate, real opening that sets the tone.
I will give it this, though.
The chocolate river that Augustus Gloop falls into in the Johnny Depp one...boy, that chocolate looks much better than the--
It doesn't look like brown water.
it doesn't look like diarrhea.
it doesn't look like diarrhea in your toilet bowl.
It looks like real thick goopy chocolate--
Yeah.
--from, like, a chocolate fountain.
The one in the original looks like diarrhea water.
It's the only fault I'm gonna say.
All right.
Only fault.
Only.
You lose.
Good day, sir.
So, if you haven't seen the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Cactory, please do.
You are given permission to fast forward through Charlie's Song by his mother.
Everybody always has since the beginning of time.
Maybe the dvd or the Blu-ray has like a chapter skip for just that song.
They have, the Blu-ray that I have has all the, like, the fun sing-along songs.
Oh.
Like the words on the screen.
Charlie's Mom song's not in there.
Is that true?
That's true.
They even know.
Who wants to sing along to that dreary, depressing nonsense?
So, yeah, watch the original.
I know it's 50-years old now.
That's fine. 
It's a glorious little movie, and it's one of my favorites of all time.
Anyway, join us next time on--
