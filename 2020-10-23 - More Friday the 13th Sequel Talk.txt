my history with friday 13th is a little spotty
i haven't necessarily seen it and sat
down and watched every last one of them
i don't think i've ever seen three
the only way to say three is in 3d and
that doesn't happen much anymore
which is that's one of the reasons i was
fortunate enough at the the what used to
be a wonderful theater in the milwaukee
area the times
i don't know if it still is i haven't
been there it's there they changed
owners
and i don't know what happened but
they'd played it there a few times in 3d
and the reason the reason they could
play it and some theaters can't is it's
dependent on the type of screen
right when they call it a silver screen
they need a literal silver screen to
properly project
that version of 3d i don't know a whole
lot about 3d from that era but
they have the right screen they could
play it so i saw it there twice and
it's kind of the only way to see that
one that's the only reason to see that
one right yeah yeah there's lots of
great 3d gags
and not a whole lot else going on no
but if you want to see a yo-yo coming
right at you that's the one to go to
did you want to talk about part 5 at all
i didn't get a chance to watch it this
time around
that's fine uh part five is the black
sheep it's the movie that
doesn't have jason in it so a lot of
people don't like it because of that
it's a copycat killer it's not actually
jason okay
i kind of love part five
love part five it's directed by
danny steinman who before this directed
some sleazy pornos and he directed the
sleazy grind house classic savage
streets
linda blair okay too bad you're not
double
jointed why because if you were
you'd be able to bend over and kiss your
ass goodbye
and this movie feels like it takes place
in the same world as savage streets
this feels like it's a paramount movie
but it feels like
a sleazy 42nd street grindhouse movie
that somehow got released to the
mainstream it is such a
like gross movie
oh, lighten up demon
you'll feel a lot better after you've shit
and all the characters are
completely exaggerated and feel
unrealistic there's like uh
there it takes place at like this group
home for troubled kids kind of like
nightmare on street three
okay um and tommy jarvis gets sent to
this group home right
but there's like uh like this redneck
lady that lives next door to this
group home with her son junior
you big dildo
eat your fucking slop
and they're doing this like ridiculously
over the top
like southern accent thing i don't know
why they have southern accents in new
jersey but
they're just like covered in dirt and
filled through the whole movie for no
reason
and every character jesus sounds like
like a vulgar new yorker
i don't know why
i gotta take a crap
crap my ass
oh god
bunch of pussies
say it like you mean it, ma
would you shut the fuck up
every character has like some sort of like attitude and they're swearing constantly
which is which goes along with savage streets because that movie has some of the best vulgar dialogue of all time
i wouldn't fucking him if he had the last dick on earth
i'm gonna fuck that bitch
go fuck an iceberg
and the and the the nudity in part five
is way more gratuitous
yeah because it comes from the director
that would do the sleazy exploitation
that's what he's used to the the the
final girl who's not really built up
throughout most of the movies she's just
the final girl because she's one of the
few characters that's left
the end of the movie takes place it's
raining and she's through the entire
climax of the movie she's wearing a
white see-through
wet t-shirt with no bra underneath jesus
for the entire climax she's fighting
jason with a chainsaw
it's completely ridiculous wow so so i
like it for that
it's it's incredibly sleazy and and
laughably stupid and uh
and speaking of too many characters oh
god
i had to make another chart and i had to
do a fold-out chart oh no
over all of her characters jesus god
these are
half of the characters it introduces uh
solely to have them killed off in that
same scene we get introduced to all
these teens at the troubled youth center
and you're like oh okay those are our
characters that are going to get killed
and then we keep
introducing new characters like and
within there's still
only like 20 minutes left of the movie
and we're still being introduced to new
characters just to be killed
god that's that's one of the worst
things you can do in a slasher movie
it's like yep we don't have enough
kindling we've got to rebuild the fire
in this case it's so gratuitous that
it's funny that yeah
they introduced uh miguel nunez who was
an actor that was in return to living
dead
damn enchiladas oh
you gonna be all right
he eats some bad enchiladas and so he
goes to an outhouse
and him his girlfriend is standing right
next to the outhouse and
they serenade each other while he's
having diarrhea all right
and that's that's friday the 13th five
ooh baby
ooh baby baby
ooh baby hey baby
but we'll move on to the better film
bunch of pussies
for the first time you really get a
sense of him as being this
unrealistically strong kind of mythic
figure
yeah he's not yeah he's he's he's
returned from hell
somehow yes everything
i tried to do in the movie also was
something that
you couldn't do as a normal human being
he doesn't use a lot of weapons in this
one necessarily
there's a lot of just crushing and
breaking yeah one of the cops he just
squishes his head
yeah because he's supernatural now and
that really does just drive it home like
you don't see anything like that in four
he's not gonna turn anybody's you know
rip anybody's head clean off
and the one after this is the first
stone with kane hotter who came out of
really brought
he really did bring a character to jason
like with the way he is
heavy breathing where his whole chest
moves and
yeah there really is a consistency of
character after he takes over where you
really get this sense of
without any dialogue this this sense of
like anger
okay sure well i feel like that works
with what the character is supposed to
be but yeah
it's not until like part six or seven
where that really comes across
well yeah because he's but that's the
thing by that point he's so far removed
from his original
sort of origins yeah
you know he's he's he's literally come
back from the dead he's literally
a supernatural monster and he doesn't
it's interesting he's sewing he doesn't
even really need to be he can just do
this because he wants to you know just
because he's a killing machine and
that's the thing he does and by freddie
versus jason that's what he is
yeah you know he's literally a tool yes
well he's still pil
he's pissed off about his his childhood
yeah his mom got decapitated and he
drowned
yeah how long are you gonna hold on to
that grudge man
jeez as long as there are people hanging
out at this camp that's true if they
would all just leave and be
outsiders come they don't know where to
walk they bring trouble
they just won't be left alone and so
does he
or leave him leave him where he is under
the fucking water for once
yeah
that was the one that was one scene or one shot that i think was actually comedic without meaning to be
it was at the very very end
you know he's been he's been all chopped up and he's underwater and he's stuck there by the chain
and then zooms in and like there's his
eye yeah alive and like he's still alive
under there i can just imagine just like a like a scott bakula
just oh boy
going on your next adventure yeah oh god
i keep doing this well it is something
kind of interesting they do in freddy
versus jason
even though that movie is pretty silly
but we at one point they do show
uh freddie kind of gets a glimpse into
jason's sort of subconscious
and he's seeing this like it's like a
purgatory that jason's in where it's
nothing but yeah dragging dead teens
into his cabinets right it's just like
this endless cycle that he goes through
it's like
this repetition yeah and that's his life
i just
i i exist solely to kill campers
yeah and that's the thing by that by
that point that he's become a
supernatural being he really just
exists to kill campers yeah that's it so
you can play that either way and that's
that's you know where it becomes
interesting
when cain hotter's you know um
characterization
you know that's interesting that starts
there where he's really kind of
past specifics and into just he kills
kids yeah
he kills campers yeah it's really
different than like the nightmare in
homestreet franchise where
like the first movie freddy comes out as
like a fully formed character
with like a full mythology and you
completely understand him and then
it's like a blueprint for all the
sequels right and then with friday the
13th
it's like they don't know what the fuck
they were doing from movie to movie for
the first
handful of it yeah and that's
that's that's people often talk about
how immediately you know in
in nightmare two where like they're
breaking the rules
friday 13th didn't really have rules
yeah yeah
it makes no sense why jason's the killer
in part two no
it's still i don't really understand it
is his mom kills in part one because
camp counselors let her son drown
because they were off having sex
she gets decapitated we find out in part
two i guess
jason didn't drowned and he saw her get
decapitated
where was he when this happened yeah so
right from right from the first step
there you're just like but
it doesn't make any sense you have to
gloss over all that yeah you just gotta
let it go
so yeah maybe if you're really watching
these you know as they were coming out
you were ready by this point to just be
like yeah he just yeah i'm ready to
accept anything
because because there's no continuity
set up
fuck it
yeah
he he yeah he's going to
fight kerry in the next one
sounds cool
you can only take it too far though yeah
you get to i don't know have you ever
seen jason goes to hell
no jason goes is a terrible terrible
terrible friday the 13th movie yeah
it's a it's a kind of okay movie on its
own
if you can separate it from friday the
13th okay it veers so far
of course where like jason is now
the body that he inhabits that he's
inhabited for all these movies
is actually just like it's a little slug
monster that's in his body
that jumps from body to body
they blow up jason at the beginning of
the movie which is kind of a fun
subversion
the opening of that movie starts with
like every cliche it's like a girl goes
to the cabin and she takes a shower and
the lights go out and jason chases her
through the woods
but then like the fbi shows up
and just blows him up and that's in the
opening of the movie
blow up jason you're like wow i wasn't
expecting that that's cool what else are
we gonna do
but then it turns out that oh jason is
just a body hopping slug monster
maybe he's been that since part six
that's one step too far yeah that's fair
you want to have jason you want to have
him killing teens
if he comes back by a bolt of lightning
that's fine but he's still jason
yeah is it was that was that the one
immediately after
manhattan yeah because manhattan ends
with him like
melting into a sewer yes yeah so yeah
there's a hurry every night at midnight
in the the sewers of manhattan they
unleash a bunch of toxic wastes
and it melts jason and he transforms
back into
his child self yeah but he's not a
mutant anymore
that's hard to come back from i'll give
him that yeah yeah
although i i have a kind of a soft spot
for that too just because
it has its own internal logic like how
does jason get to manhattan when he gets
on a boat
and you know that's a good little
captive area for everyone to get killed
in
yeah that totally works for me i don't
mind part eight a lot of people hate
that one
because it's called jason takes
manhattan and he spends 90 of the movie
on a boat
and then when he gets to manhattan it's
vancouver well um
but jason on a boat great that's
different yeah
it's the last one that has that like we
were talking about like with the harry
manfredini music and the general like
tone of these movies part eight is the
last one to really
have that samey feel to it
and so i like it because of that and i
like the look of jason mask
jason when he takes his mask off he
looks terrible
so it's got some good kills i'm not too
down on jason takes manhattan
the toxic waste is fucking stupid
well yeah
but again what are you going to do you know
he's just going to go to manhattan and
get
you know locked somewhere again
something's got to happen
he's been under the lake for fucking two movies already
yeah
we got we got to move this along somehow
you can't just go back
