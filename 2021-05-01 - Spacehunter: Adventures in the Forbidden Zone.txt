rich
what happens when you make a cult movie that never develops a cult
wow
space hunter adventures in the forbidden zone
it's the story of three unlikely heroes
their destinationk: the forbidden zone
their mission: ve three stranded women
one in a million
i'll take that bet yeah
that's
yeah you know what
i want to start off by saying children are stupid
this has been true since the beginning
this has been true since beginning of
time but it was true
about 35 years ago the reason the only
reason we're watching this
is because when i was a child
i remember liking this movie this is
this is like my early childhood brain
any
anything that had anything to do with
space star trek
star wars i i loved it and this was a
movie
i probably rented multiple times from
the local video store it was this
and ice pirates
another movie that you could say is a
cult movie without the cults and another
another cult movie without the code they
are both
early 80s science fiction movies that
have been
completely forgotten
ice pirates i think has endured a tiny
bit
just because the director of it also
directed mac and me
and tammy and the t-rex okay so people
say oh tammy and the t-rex that's a
crazy movie did you know the guy that
made that also made ice pirates
i can tell you i was six years old and i
love
the robot thank you percy that was
wonderful
see i've still never seen ice pirates it
was a robot man jay
i have that's like c3po
speaking of c3po space hunters
space hunter the adventures in the
forbidden zone
uh is what happens when you say hey star
wars is popular
mad max is popular well no no it's what
happens when you say
star wars is popular oh star wars is
expensive to
film matt max is popular
they just shot that in the desert we can
do that throw some [ __ ] around
i will say this about space hunter i had
never even heard of it
until we started getting uh vhs copies
yeah we have uh
a few here there's multiple editions of
space hunt
multiple editions of space hunter yeah
uh that first one there on the end
that's some decent cover art yeah no
this is this is what i remember in the
video store
okay this is what i rented multiple
times jay that's the one that makes it
look like an exciting
space adventure film as opposed to the
other ones which are just like
like promotional stills from the movies
so boring there are about
30 seconds that take place in space
that's true
it's you know what it's technically
correct sure
sure the escape shuttles have been
programmed
to seek out the nearest e-type or
earth-type planet you will be landed and
processed with
full security
but uh yeah no we started getting copies
of those and you you would mention like
maybe best of the worst worthy i didn't
know what to do with it because i saw it
like
oh i remember this when i was a kid
it's probably too good for best of the
worst i mean ivan reitman was the
executive producer
i i will say after because now i'm
watching it for the first time i'll say
it is too good for best of the worst
yeah it's not a movie to make fun of
this is like last year when mike and i
did rawhead racks
on half in the bag where it's like it's
the completely inappropriate format for
that movie but what else do you do with
it
it doesn't fit any of our other formats
this is
this is what happens when you take like
um the script
from one of the uh movies we typical
science fiction movies we watch
best of the worst and you raise
everything up to the level of
competent it's one of those movies that
looks both expensive and cheap at the
same time yeah
because there's like some really
wonderful map paintings in the movie and
like they're really well done but then
you see this like jagged edge of where
the matte painting meets the actual
like onset photography and i don't know
why it's jagged i don't know if they
thought that would make it blend in more
than just like straight lines or
something but
your your eyes just go right to it so
the whole movie has that kind of feel to
it
it's also like some unusual art
direction to it because
we're into the 80s at this point and the
80s had decided that
the future is industrial yes
technology has in the 80s had a very
specific look this is what the future is
and
this almost feels like a throwback i
thought that just from the opening music
50s 70s yeah it definitely has that like
like 50s
50s action music
which i get well for okay before we get
any further let's explain what this
movie is oh yeah you know what that's
probably a good idea
before we get cause people are like what
are they talking about
uh space hunter adventures of the
forbidden zone tells the story of
not han solo he's flying through space
with his sidekick
sex slave whatever she is she's a robot
her name well
you've learned she's a robot it changes
nothing in the story but
her name is chalmers super nintendo
chalmers
and meanwhile three space babes
crash land on an earth-like planet
which is code for it's cheap to shoot
the desert uh-huh and he goes down there
to rescue them
uh for i guess for a bouncer there's a
bounty to rescue them yes
three thousand mega credits three
thousand space bucks
three thousand space bucks which is a
lot of space bucks i i would hope so
i would you know i would have gone like
i don't like three million or something
you know what the funny thing is the
three babes
they're just three babes oh yeah they
have no character i expected them to be
like you know
the space emperor's daughters or
something
please we just want to go home something
where there's a reason they're worth so
much yeah
although maybe 3000 space bucks isn't a
lot but this guy
is enough for this this guy he's so
broke he's so broke
he kicks a ship and it makes r2d2 noises
make them make them senators yeah
they're just three random women
yeah yeah but they land on this planet
they get kidnapped by
who i didn't realize right away is
michael ironside playing
uh palpatine from rise of skywalker
you don't understand i'm very
old and i need you
i need your vitality
she will strike me down and pledge
herself
as a sick well he doesn't kidnap them
because he doesn't show up until like
halfway through the movie i mean he's
the he's the leader
he yeah he he they the space babes end
up in his clutches
yeah so then uh wolf is our not han solo
character's name he
put two apps wolf with two apps cause
space sci-fi but he goes down to the
planet to try and rescue them
uh ends up teaming up with a very young
molly ringwalds
this is a year before 16 candles
i can't believe this they [ __ ] forgot
my birthday
uh and also she probably would have been
too good for this movie
by that point right uh oh yeah yeah this
is right but this is like early in
a lot of people's careers which is kind
of the interesting thing to talk about
with this movie
um but one of his rivals and also trying
to to rescue the space babes
is ernie hudson you help me go in and
get the girls
i give you 750 mega credits you fly us
all out of here afterwards i throw in
another couple hundred
that's almost a thousand mega credits
and i'm only being this generous
because of our former friendship what
form of friendship
who should have played wolf you would
have been a much better wolf
i just think of the same [ __ ] thing
yeah when i was watching this he's
pretty good in this movie
he's he's you don't think of him as like
the tough guy
but he plays pretty good like tough guy
sidekick
he's more charming than our hero he's
more competent than her hero
smarter than our hero yeah
yeah there's that trend of like trying
to like movies like this that try to
have the han solo type character
and they always cast the most boring
nothing actor in the part
that's the case with this guy peter
strauss or peter krause i looked at him
and he yeah tons of credits he's a
working actor but yeah he shouldn't be
our lead in this
the point is i'm giving you a chance to
make some extra money
you need my ship for transportation
or else you're stuck here aren't you the
deal
is 50 50 or nothing that squad aren't
worth
50 50s well we mentioned the people
who's in this i i
one of the reasons i thought this was
going to be an interesting one to
revisit
all of the bizarre ghostbusters
connections
produced by evan reitman co-starring
ernie hudson music by elmer bernstein
and did you did you pick up on the
fourth one the harold reimus cameo the
uncredited harold ramba's voice cameo
how do you miss that voice it's clearly
ego
yeah i got a lot of messages for you
wolf we got a transmission from a guy in
omega-6 he's got eight tons of beryllium
scrap he wants you to pick it up as soon
as you can
we had part of a slinky but i
straightened it
and i noticed with the score there's a
couple hints of ghostbusters throughout
it the kind of like
ethereal kind of like theremin like
noises those are in this movie
what was that um
wait um see i was i was trying i was
literally i was trying to find
information about this movie and i just
couldn't
i'm kind of wondering were they making
ghostbusters when they filmed this
well this is 80. this came out in 83
this came out the year before
ghostbusters
okay this came out here's another
interesting bit of trivia yes
the week before return of the jedi
on purpose on purpose okay
like like oh people want to go see this
people are going to be excited about
science fiction and
after return of the jedi comes out
they're only going to go see return of
the jedi
we'll make our opening weekend bucks
okay and that's what they did they made
seven million on the opening weekend
and it's petered out to 16 million
overall and then a single person has
ever talked about the movie
until now yeah
yeah ivan reitman his early career is
really like before he started doing
mediocre comedies yeah his early career
was really bizarre he's from canada
and he made like a movie called cannibal
girls
with eugene levy and i think some of the
other sctv people are in it
which there's a cameo by that film on
the marquee and ghostbusters too
but yeah that and then like heavy metal
which this sort of reminded me a bit of
again with that kind of industrial
sci-fi look
that was incredible but yeah his early
career his early
i guess canadian stuff is just like i
don't know
trying everything it was so he's sort of
like a like a
this movie especially reminded me of
like a like a roger corman movie
or like a charles band movie those kind
of like huckster
get in and make your money and get out
type movies because i found out it kind
of
was okay 3d 3d is a fad let's
crank out a 3d movie yeah i looked it up
after the fact i would not have guessed
that this was a 3d movie
like while watching it i didn't even
think about that because there's no 3d
gimmicks or anything
in the the early 80s was that sort of 3d
revival where you had like
friday the 13th friday the 13th jaws 3d
yeah amityville 3d ville 3d
some other ones uh oh another one that
this movie reminded me a lot of
is metal storm the destruction of jared
sin
which is a charles band produced movie
and this is another one where it's like
what if it was mad max but had laser
guns
and this also has a half human half
robot villain in it
okay it's in the deserts
i've never i've never seen this i think
i've seen this on our shelves and that's
all i know about it
that's tim thomson there he's in it um
so like yeah charles banded this which
is also a 3d movie
um and and so it's yeah that that early
three or that
early 80s 3d revival it was very
short-lived
but all those movies have a very
specific look to them like because of
the
type of lenses they had to shoot the 3d
on where it's very like
soft almost to the point of looking out
of focus and
space hunter doesn't have that it just
looks like a movie and so i was
surprised to learn that it was 3d
i never would have guessed that while
watching it i looked up the trailer in
3d
glorious 3d in two weeks
columbia pictures will present 3d as
you've never
seen it before the first quality 3d film
backed by a major studio
the first to use a new state-of-the-art
3d process
this is space hunter adventures in the
forbidden zone
the only thing is like maybe the the
credits at the end it's like
the end well the beginning credits
the beginning credits which i wanted to
point out i think might have been an
optical mistake
because it's a space hunter comes out at
you and i wasn't thinking 3d i was
thinking of like superman
yeah that kind of credits um so space
hunter comes out
and then space center goes away and then
adventures from the forbidden zone comes
out but it's smaller and down
farther in the frame where i think it
was supposed to be like space hunter and
then adventures
of the forbidden zone comes out
underneath it so it's together
and they just [ __ ] up and it was too
expensive to redo it
that's how it looks it looks like a
mistake
yeah yeah it's
it's it's credits it's just the title
it's just the title of the film jay
nobody cares but uh yeah that's again
the elmer bernstein music like i was
actually i kind of enjoyed this movie
like it's pretty forgettable but it's
interesting because of all the other
elements to it all the ghostbusters
connections but that music right off the
bat i was like hey
this is fun this isn't like john
williams it feels more like a throwback
to the actual
kind of corny you know 50s to 70s sci-fi
somewhere in there before things got a
little more high-tech with
with star wars i've read something
albert bernstein said where it's like
this slapped together they wanted
something they wanted it out quick
they wanted to cash in on 3d it needed
to be out the week before
return to the jedi specifically so i
just slapped some western music together
okay yeah it makes me wonder if he even
had time to finish the score because
there's parts in the movie where
it feels like it should have score and
it just doesn't because there's that
first when
when wolf first lands on the planet
there's it's a really
impressive uh uh train that comes up
that looks like it's like outfitted to
look like a pirate ship
yeah it's like this is really cool
looking and so the first big action
scene is on that train he's running
around he's beating people up and it's
just like
dead silence
so there's no action music for the big
action scene but then there's rousing
action music when he's
forcing molly ringwald to take a bath
maybe now you're gonna smell like one
such a weird choice that's an
uncomfortable scene too
a little bit yeah especially when you
know like how young molly ringwald is in
this
like i guess i don't know how old she
was in real life but 16 candles
obviously she's playing a
teenager but you know there were
reshoots to this
oh yeah this is there's some parallels
to solo
okay smuggler's tale that's not the
title of the movie
yeah no they they started filming this
it was called adventures in the creep
zone
was the title oh and
they can the director and they re-shot
everything they'd done
oh yeah was it more perverted when they
say creep
i have zone is that what they have
trouble finding much
information like a lot of this is just
like trivia buried in imdb
yeah but i i guess space hunter was even
more of an
[ __ ] okay than the original because i
was when i was watching it i was
thinking like it it's
almost riding that line of like being
because the main villain
uh uh michael ironside originally called
king creep
bring them to me
king creep in the movies called like
over dog overdog
not overlord no they call him over dog
which i think is another
bad max thing okay overdog is a name you
would expect somebody in mad max to have
that's true yeah but he's he's kind of a
sex pervert
like when the the space babes get sent
to him and he's like take off their
clothes
that one the one in the center
undress her
slowly and so i was wondering if maybe
the original idea for this movie was
because heavy metal is kind of an adult
you know sci-fi thing there's boobs and
stuff and
so i was wondering if this was meant to
be more adults and then they were like
wait
we could sell this to children let's
reshoot it
that's that's the feeling i get okay
yes
yes producers saw that like
what the [ __ ] star wars is big now why
are we making this creep thing
why are we making a sex pervert film in
space let's
let's redoing this
get on the bernstein him whip something
together he's got three weeks
just take a couple pieces of his
ghostbusters score he's working on
throw it in there i'm wondering if they
were working on ghostbusters when they
made this
didn't ghostbusters have kind of a
notoriously quick pre-production
i know like dan aykroyd's original ideas
were all crazy but
the actual like production of the movie
i want to say it came together kind of
quickly god i don't remember
so it's it's you know right around there
it's right around that same era which
when you put these two movies back to
back is sort of shocking
just going back to the 3d i i found the
siskel and ebert review of this
oh great yeah and the only time we ever
bring up siskel and eva on the show is
when we talk about
reviews that they hate like i always
bring them up because they had
notoriously bad takes on horror movies
ebert gives us a positive view
more or less not a not a not a solid
positive but it's like
why did they his his entire review boil
down why the [ __ ] do this need to be 3d
it's if you want to see roger ebert
bitching about 3d
go look up his review for this he
[ __ ] about 3d okay
and then siskel jumps in to say another
movie she's garbage
i can't recommend this movie in 3d but
if it turned up on cable
or on television i'd look at it and if
it turned up on cable or television i
wouldn't
i think this is an awful picture if it
were in one dude
the movie's not garbage oh well i'm not
in chinese cisco
that's true he had the worst taste
between the two of them
yeah although although ebert's uh taste
on horror movies was usually pretty
terrible yeah so i guess it evens out
they didn't like gremlins they didn't
like gremlins they they hated 80s
slasher movies
they doxed people before doxing was a
thing really
i think it was i want to say it's betsy
palmer who played the the killer in the
first friday the 13th movie
either her or the producers of friday
the 13th
they flat out gave out their addresses
on the show it's like write to them to
tell them what
what filth this is it's pretty shocking
yeah
i thought it was less interesting than
any of the star wars pictures or shout
outs
for sure shot in 2d and this is a ripoff
to me well i'm not recommending it
that'll make any happen it'll make me
any happier okay
i mean go go well we're talking about
the kind of cheap quickness of the whole
thing
yeah there's a fair amount of different
like creatures and
half human half robot monsters and they
all look kind of half-assed except for
michael ironside
he looks pretty cool that's what i
remember as a kid
he's in this weird like like uh claw
machine contraption
but he's also on like just like a crane
that you would normally mount your
camera on
that's probably what they use yeah no
they didn't
build anything special just for this
movie yeah they mounted him onto a
camera crane
and they gave him they gave him giant
lobster claws and yeah he's having fun
i need a substance you never dreamed of
earther
ah you can't hurt me
but i can't hurt you you i was thinking
of
rise of skywalker palpatine uh
palpatine's on that similar kind of like
yeah device that moves them around
limits his mobility which makes him way
less scary than i think he's supposed to
be
if can you imagine that if he didn't
have the crane he's just walking around
he's got those giant claw arms oh yeah
he needed the crate well that's that's
another aspect of the movie that made me
think of like charles band
movies from that time like metal storm i
mentioned has a half human half robot
character
or like robot jocks like those type of
movies or
uh eliminators which is the the robot
half human half robot with the tank body
like it has it feels like a charles band
movie but charles band had nothing to do
with it
ivan reitman the director of
ghostbusters
the year before he made ghostbusters
yeah yeah i would say
in relation to charles band this is a
compliment to charles band to say this
movie looks like a charles band film
it's an insult to ivan reitman to say it
looks like a charles banfield
uh i looked up on looking up information
on this and
um ivan rightman labeled the movie
a space adventure with a sense of humor
okay according to wikipedia ivan reitman
called the movie
terrible
so that's probably from two different
interviews probably from two different
interviews i'm assuming one was
considerably after the fact
yeah i mean there is kind of a
tongue-in-cheek element to the movie
um i don't know what it is about like
fantasy movies from this era where they
think
the the they all need like the comedy
relief sidekick
and the comedy relief sidekick their
idea of humor is to just make them
really annoying
what the hell are you what do you think
i am your scrolling earth bag i'm a
woman
because molly ringwald in this movie is
insufferably annoying
i never said i wouldn't eat doggy so i
don't eat that much
here's the weird thing she kind of grows
on me she starts off really annoying
yeah
she's like a compulsive liar and she's
just whiny yeah yeah
i guess she gets a little better as the
movie goes along i have
some amount of sympathy for her growing
up on this [ __ ] up planet
filled with disease-ridden creeps filled
with disease-ridden creeps
uh diaper babies from nothing but
trouble i was gonna mention that exact
same thing they look like dan aykroyd
from nothing but trouble
you have the weird amazon warrior the
water amazon warriors who just show up
oh yeah that was another part where i
was like was this movie meant to be more
horny
originally i'm assuming i must i have to
assume it was
that this is a creepy sex thing
good breeding man i'll bet breeding with
us would kill him
i'll take that bet that the producers
just completely
threw the original plan and out out the
window no we're going to rip off star
wars mad max
because they they show up they kidnap
our heroes and then our heroes run away
there's a lot of that in this movie we
never see them again they meet someone
and run away almost immediately yeah
like the diaper babies show up they're
wrapped in bubble wrap
and they're descending from the ceiling
and i was like oh this is gonna be a fun
sequence
and they're like bye and i'm not saying
their heroes just run away they just run
away it takes five seconds well your
film's called adventures
in the creep zone so your film's called
adventures in the forbidden zone you
have to have
multiple adventures which means they
just run away from different people
they must have spent all their [ __ ]
money on that train at the beginning
because
everything else is pretty cheap yeah the
truly
the end the the train and the obstacle
course that's a fun sequence
the the maze i think they call it it's
very like uh
beyond thunderdome but this would have
been before beyond thunderdome
but a few years yeah but yeah so it's
one thing they didn't rip off
mad max mad rip mad max ripped off this
for thunderdome i can guarantee george
miller saw this film
and said yeah i'm gonna kick up my game
but yeah no that's that's a fun sequence
that holds uh
it's like a it's just like beyond
thunderdome where people are outside
like cheering on as people get horribly
violently killed in this this maze of
this pit
um i did notice there's one shot where
molly ringwald
she's stuck in the maze and she's
running out and there's like flames that
shoot from the sides
and there is a [ __ ] flame that comes
like this close to her face
i don't know if that was a mistake on
the timing or what but she looks like
she almost got her [ __ ] face burned
off
she may have actually almost gotten her
face burned off i don't know
it was a different time it was a
different time there weren't the safety
protocols there are now
especially when you're working with
weirdo cheap canadians
a couple years before um hollywood
safety became a much bigger issue
in hollywood a couple years
on the set of mac and me instead of mac
and me when the
the main character like slipped in a
banana pill
that's some
it changed all the rules in hollywood
changed all the rules all the safety
protocols yeah
is character making me in a was in a
wheelchair i don't remember macking me
at all why aren't we talking about
makame
oh god don't give them ideas
now everyone's going to be requesting
mac and me the best the most interesting
thing about mac and me is the original
ending
what was the original ending of mac oh
the [ __ ] kid in the wheelchair gets
shot by a cop and dies
are you kidding and then mack has to
bring him back to life with his magical
powers oh
yeah no he doesn't die permanently but
you do see him like wheeling towards
mack and his
his magical alien family and you just
see him get
shot through the [ __ ] chest it's
horrific and it was in a kid's film
here's my memory of mac and me when i
was in grade school
it was a reward for something the school
got to watch mac and me
oh that's not much of a reward no and
especially because i had already seen it
and i knew
it was a terrible terrible day jake
one of the other adventures they go on
talking about all their many many
amazing adventures in this film
and all the uh the amazing characters
and creatures
they get they're in like a pit it's one
of the other times they meet up with
ernie hudson
yeah and there's all these little like
jason voorhees babies
yeah surrounding them they're like
whistling adam
but then they don't do anything don't
they throw bombs at them or something
yeah but then they just run away yeah
they just run away
gotta get through the adventures quick
we only got 90 minutes
i will say that's a relief of this movie
it's only 90 minutes
not that it was like an agonizing it was
kind of an entertaining movie to watch
but
it is like oh remember when epic space
adventure movies could just be
90 minutes see i don't know it's more
entertaining for you
probably because you're completely fresh
to it for me this is
this is this is literally revisiting a
movie i probably haven't seen and
it could literally be 35 years okay
since i've seen this
this is this is a movie when i was a kid
oh i like that movie as kid and watching
it now
it was just like one big letdown yeah oh
yeah did you actually have any sort of
anticipation that it would hold up
though
well yeah just because of who was
involved with it
okay see we got we got this movie in the
mail and we're wondering what to do with
it like is it too good for best of the
worst i don't know
and i put it in the vc arm and i
i cause i was a kid i had no idea who
was anyone and i said
oh that's that's [ __ ] ivan rightman
now this ghostbusters
connection oh oh that's harold ravis i
can hear that's clearly i turned it off
and so i actually kind of was expecting
it to be german okay more charming than
it is
maybe one of those like oh under-seen
underrated gems
yeah yeah it's not bad it's it's pyrite
it's what it's fool's gold that's
probably oh it's pyrite yeah i thought
you said
no no no now you're a chip what are you
talking about
no this movie it was it was it was
pyrite for me it was fool's gold
yeah yeah it falls between the cracks of
like i mentioned all the mad max
rip-offs
i have some of them here these were big
in italy
italians in the early 80s italians love
to rip off mad max
and escape from new york often in the
same movie
i don't know if escape from new york was
like a massive hit in italy or what but
there's a ton of
movies that were both of those at once
but we have like 20 20
texas gladiators 1990 the bronx warriors
and warrior of the lost world so these
are all mad max ripoffs and
there's a charm to how bad they are yeah
and how cheap they are
yeah and uh uh space hunter is like
it's decent production value not great
but not laughably bad but it's also not
uh
legitimately like clever or charming
yeah in a way that
makes it shine brighter than the budget
would allow
it's it's right between the cracks of
like everything it's like it was
scientifically designed to be
forgettable
i'm not kidding
this is an avatar both 3d movies
that's true that's true
when are the the 12 sequels to space
after gonna come out
well they've been working on them for
the last 30 years jay just like james
cameron's like james cameron
avatar sequels they'll be coming
eventually
an ironic twist of fate the space hunter
sequel the avatar sequel will come
out the same year space hunter will come
out a week before
it's like poetry arrives
we did it
