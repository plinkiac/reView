well we took a little break
uh ate some donuts
decided to to break out some alcohol
as we
here's to that
as we continue to plow our way through this mess let's dig
in
"now take it easy diane and let's just sit down and have a nice simple chat"
"you got any coffee"
"no"
"i don't have any cigarettes either"
uh we finally meet diane
which we honestly that was the one we
called like when you see when you see
those like
laura dern has laura turns playing
diamond she it has
it has to be we don't even know diane's
gonna be in the show yeah you know it's
gonna be
it's gonna be diane yeah i knew it was
going to be you
they have so much i mean she and comical
often have so much history together
with all that yeah you know and david
lynch projects it's like
it's got to be that's awesome
it's very strange in it it's like well
but
25 years later and it's a very strange
thing and she's [ __ ] fantastic
she's great on this everything you'd
expect hell of a sass pot
diane at least in tulpa form yeah and
that's something to point out too is
that apparently the tulpas retain
information yeah from who they're
they're copied from
because i was initially thinking she has
a a great monologue
where right before this is when we kind
of realized that she's about to kill
all the fbi agents and i felt afraid
and he saw the fear in me but it's like
the real
diane kind of breaks through for a
minute when she's talking about how evil
cooper raped her and this is how
you know this is the last time she saw
him and she's like i'm not me
i'm not me that whole monologue is
fantastic yeah but uh and yeah at that
point you have no doubt like that
happened that yeah this isn't like she's
just trying to to lower their guard by
being emotional so she can kill them
like she's
expressing real feelings yeah of what
happened to her and it's yeah it's not
me i've been
it's it's heartbreaking she's so good in
that scene fantastic yeah
yeah she's she's telling them everything
they need to know that's not her she's
not there she's in
she's in the office or whatever she says
yeah and she gives them all the clues
right there yeah
we can talk more about uh like the
office in vegas
that i guess is mr c's office with uh
what's his name
oh oh the the the winkies guy from
mullendrap
exactly i had a dream about this place
oh boy
so there's like an office in in las
vegas
that i think is part of part of evil
coop's business
because that's where there's a hit on
dougie no they said they send
uh jennifer jason lee oh yeah
daddy mixed up wendy's
the those characters feel like they're
right out of a tarantino movie yeah
i'm sure the casting of tim roth was
very deliberate i love you
i love you shontel i love you
i love you honey bunny but yeah they're
just
hit men that are obsessed with junk
foods and
their dialogue it feels like a little
bit not a tarantino influence but
maybe riffing on maybe those type of
characters you would see in a tarantino
movie yeah
you're in my driveway
we're not in your driveway we're not
even close to your [ __ ] driveway
[ __ ]
there and it's mostly worth it just for
their fate which is hilarious
well that's going way back we were
talking about how the world has kind of
been corrupted by
there's been an uptick in like gun
violence and drug use like
they're one of dougie's neighbors just
pulls up and he's mad that they're kind
of blocking a tiny bit of his driveway
and just pulls out a gun just some
random guy
because he doesn't happen to know that
they're they're contract killers so they
shoot at him and he's like
oh you're gonna shoot at me are you and
yeah he just blows them away
the cops are down at the end of the
street not doing [ __ ] yeah the mitchell
brothers are like
people are stressed these days
but i just it makes me laugh so hard
there's all that setup or like they do
they do assassinate
um what the prison warden yeah but other
than that they're just kind of mumbling
around it's like
oh we got you some phones we're getting
wendy's
and then they just randomly get shot
yeah
well that's that's like like we have
said
several times at this point the idea
that there's it's a long lead up to a
payoff
yeah there's a lot of that and i feel
like you know david lynch is very
famously uh
a big proponent of transcendental
meditation and i feel like that's never
been more
prevalent or more apparent in his work
than it is in this okay
where it's like we're going to watch a
guy sweep a floor
for five minutes we're gonna take our
time
on everything and let you kind of think
about what you're seeing and not just
race to get to the next plot point
you're not even really going to think
about it that much until you realize hey
wait a minute isn't that jacques back
there
yeah that never really comes back i
guess that's his maybe his brother yeah
there's another there's another another
one sure
he's not a tulpa he's just another guy
yeah it's hard to
say how important the whole like yeah
office in vegas and the guy from winkies
and he's saying to his like don't ever
let this happen to you like don't let
what
i don't understand what does he have on
you it doesn't matter
shentel just comes and shoots you anyway
[ __ ] it i don't know and it's kind of
you know
even though a lot of these people are
connected to
the big plot line they're just doing
their jobs and living their lives
basically
because there are there are plot lines
that are important but
it's kind of hard to talk to talk about
how it connects to the whole
like obviously matthew lillard is super
important because he finds
uh major briggs's body yeah having not
aged for 25 years apparently
and he's fantastic brother he's yeah we
didn't mention matthew lillard but
i feel like he people think of him as
like from scooby-doo movies or he's
annoying and scream or whatever but
he's really he's he's a really good
actor and he's great on this
please i didn't kill ruth i loved her
i loved her i don't know what is
happening to me
why can't you help me please please
yeah and he just he portrays like the
way he portrays his alibi and everything
falling apart and he can't really
explain it and the way he's like
so sure of himself at first he's like i
didn't do anything wrong this isn't
going to be a problem
and just into actually blubbering fear
because he
has to tell them everything that he's
scared of yeah basically
just like he doesn't want anything bad
to happen he certainly doesn't want his
head to
fall off in chunks
oh my god
he's dead i mean that whole aspect of it
kind of like when you talk about the
original show
the original series and how it was like
uh not a parody but
it was it's definitely done in the style
of like a nighttime like a prime time
soap opera yeah
and you can't do that again because
those don't exist no one knows what
those are anymore but now what you have
is a ton of like
like ncis or like law and order those
types of shows yeah
and those scenes in particular really
felt like they were kind of informed by
that
um like jane adams as her
uh kind of snarky funny uh
uh coroner character oh so great
cause of death took me a while
but i think someone cut this man's head
off
but obviously that's important because
you have to get you have to get
uh the fbi out there to start
discovering
you know the woodsmen and the
connections
to where you know to the to the black
lodge and the white lodge in the
space that's out there where the
cooper's basically manipulating his way
through before he gets to earth
you know because that takes a few
episodes too that doesn't happen right
away
no he goes falling through space for
like 20 minutes
which is just shaking lights behind them
i love that too the low like the
low-tech
uh it's like a student fill almost but
it works because we're in this unnatural
world yeah yeah it's very diy but who's
to you know
it's not like you'd think it's wrong
because you've never seen this
it looks cheap but maybe maybe the real
world's [ __ ] cheap you know
that's worth pointing out is the special
effects i know some people complain
about them
and it's like there are aspects of the
show that feel kind of
cheap corset
and lazy one in particular there's a
part when
tammy is looking at a photo of cooper oh
it got so mad and it's it's clearly
a screenshot from the original series
and he's clearly in the red room
that's that's just can't be possible it
doesn't make any sense so that drove me
nuts yeah that's the one thing um
but a lot of the other effects to me
feel like uh
i i don't think david lynch cares much
about special effects
and it's more about like well do what
you have to to convey the idea
and it's like it doesn't have to look
realistic no more than that it doesn't
have to look photorealistic it looks
unnatural which
it's just like so it's yeah it's just
like like a fire that kind of crumples
and falls apart
the person's head yeah like crushes them
like paper and
yeah some of the stuff in the white of
kind of reminded me of the
in the mouth of madness oh yeah he's
tearing his face apart
some of that i was thinking of like
terry gilliam's monty python animation
in part
of that too yeah just fold it up i don't
know
who cares it's not real but this place
isn't real
exactly i was okay with a lot of that
and it seemed like well then we were
you know feeling like a lot of the money
went into episode 8 anyway
yeah well that's how you know like okay
he can do good special effects
when it's important when it's important
exactly otherwise don't worry about it
it's just the story
but that i think that also works to a
certain favor like
things were like the movement of the
woodsmen like that's kind of like
herky-jerky silent movie
yeah yeah that doesn't cost anything to
do and it's creepy as hell
yes you know the way that they that when
uh when rey shoots evil coop
and they come to kind of heal him and
like just kind of scratch at him for a
while but there's all the overlays
they're just yeah dissolving between all
these shots
yeah which reminded me not only of
silent film in general but also of early
david lynch like the experimental stuff
oh yeah you know
um yeah and some of the special effects
looked like some of his weirdo animated
things that he's made over the years
yeah you know what's six men getting
sick apart from just sculptures they
have like a bunch of random cuts while
things get thrown at the wall you know
yeah
yeah it's not yeah it's the same kind of
thing but that was actually uh
something that we were seeing throughout
which was a really interesting thing for
me
was callbacks to david lynch's entire
career
yeah yeah this feels like the
culmination of everything he's done
yeah we're like the yeah the bit with uh
you know yeah with dougie stumbling
around reminds us
of eraserhead there was that one scene
with the fbi guy
how are we gonna find the right one
wilson how many times have i
told you this is what we do in the fbi
okay paul and then there's like shots of
the
of driving you know over the highway at
night just shots of the road it feels
right out of lost highway yep
lots of shots like that yeah yeah a lot
of it's not even necessarily callbacks
so much as
just every every type of style
everything he's done just sort of
it all works its way into those yeah all
the all the uh the stuff
you know that uh episode eight but also
some stuff outside the world with coop
you know going through whatever that
also reminded me a lot of like
you know the more art experimental stuff
well yeah like that's all you had for
you know
you you you gotta make a racer head for
five years cause you keep running out of
money
all you can afford is shaking some
lights around behind a guy
that's fine go do it you know tell the
story yeah and that really felt like
that to me
god but it really gave a great feeling
of space to some of those
some of those shots where like where
he's going up like
going up or he falls into the the metal
thing and the
endless ocean oh yeah that just felt so
isolated yeah but he crawls up on top of
it he's in space again
like okay but you know you get the idea
that it's outside of
reality yeah you know and it really it
felt huge
you know even with this cheap effects as
that you still got a great sense of that
feeling
and just you know when when cooper is
falling through space you don't know how
long it's going to take him
it felt like that could have gone on for
a really really long time that could
have been a whole episode
who knows you know he shows up in the in
the box in new york apparently
what did she say audrey
we've been over this tell me
stop it but we'll start talking about
audrey boy we're
really i remember on that first watch it
was every every episode she wasn't there
just like because we knew she was coming
she was just confirmed to be in the cast
it's not like like i wasn't anticipating
donna no but i was even if i knew she
was on the show i probably wouldn't have
been anticipating her
she's donna yeah but i was more worried
it was going to be something like like
alicia witt where it's just like oh no
she's going to be in like two scenes
oh yeah and that's going to be it like
god i hope not like audrey's such a
great character such an important
character yeah
she's a key component until they decided
to kind of make her go to the sidelines
a bit as the show went along but
initially she was a big part of it she
should have been you know part of it all
the way through
yeah she was very important even up to
the end again she's she's she was
in the last couple episodes that whole
thing with the you know she was
protesting against the the development
of the woods which apparently
happened in the meantime oh well
you blew up that bank for nothing
uh but yeah so we finally we finally get
to see audrey
but she's completely isolated from the
rest of the cast she's in a house
and she's yelling at her husband who's
that one guy
he passed away recently too did another
one yeah
and and they don't really seem to like
each other very much
and he's got a lot of work to do he's
and he's sleepy
and experienced it's already late and
i'm getting sleepy
it's already late and i'm so sleepy and
i really got more on subsequent watches
it was just kind of the ratcheting
of how confused and nervous she is yeah
and that she's panicking basically
yeah it's just her reaching out for
anything because she's so confused
and has that panic of like she can't get
out
but then finally when it's time to go
she didn't want to go
it's just another problem yeah
especially in
the initial watch just like yeah where
it turns out she's like well i can't go
i got my code he's so irritated i
was with him but this is where we're
also introduced he has a line at one
point where he's like uh
uh he says something about do you want
me to to write you out of the story
are you gonna stop playing games or do i
have to end your story too
yeah or do i have to fix you too yeah
and that's where you perk up and you're
like what
does this mean yeah and because it just
feels i mean there's already been
like sort of a an aspect like we talk
about with like fire walk with me how
the opening of that movie is a static tv
that gets bashed in with a sledgehammer
you're like i see what you're doing yeah
and the opening of
uh of season three we see a big
empty box with cameras pointing at and
the guy watching just this vacuous box
that feels like a continuation like
we're talking about tv here i get it
yeah um so it's it's not
that doesn't feel like meta but then
when you get to
audrey and her husband and he's talking
about writing her out of the story
and you're like what are we what are we
doing here yeah i feel like i'm someone
else
have you ever had that feeling charlie
no and then you start thinking about
she's like i want to see billy she keeps
talking about billy and you're like who
is billy
and you're thinking i was thinking of
like on season two of twin peaks
audrey was dating a character played by
billy zane
is that it is she talking about billy
zane the actor
and then she gets to the roadhouse and
they introduce they're like
ladies and gentlemen audrey's dance
ladies
and gentlemen our trees
dance
which in the context of the show that's
not what it is it's just a piece of
music that she danced to
and she's as stunned as anybody at first
yeah it's like my what
and so for a brief moment she's the
center of attention
it's just like the old times of being a
young starlet and the
world's in front of you and she's so
into it and then everything breaks out
into violence because this is scary twin
peaks world
[Applause]
but that's another thing where you're
like are we we're referencing things
outside of the show
right with that and then and then she's
panicking and yelling get me out of here
and
she's not there at all yes
i mean who's to say for sure but my
interpretation of the way i'm thinking
of it is that what we're seeing that
last moment with her
because we don't see her for the last
couple episodes that's it
uh i i think that's sheryl and fenn
that's not audrey horn at that point
that's sheryl and fenn she's crossed
over
wow she's woken up her from her dream
she's talking about billy zane
she's having memories of what it was
like to be you know
the young starlet she's the center of
attention they're playing audrey's dance
and then
she wakes up from that and now she's
just middle-aged cheryl and fun
huh this is existentialism 101.
oh [ __ ] you i didn't get the impression
that it was
like a uh a lead-in to like oh
if we do more seasons we'll explain this
to me it felt like
that felt that feels like a stop yeah it
felt like this is the end of audrey
yeah she's in that empty white room yeah
with non-descript
clothes and looking into a mirror and
that's just where she is forever like
yeah but yeah those mentions about like
writing her out like we're talking about
and i i don't
know if there's any information about
this out there but i heard something
somewhere that uh sherilyn fenn and
david lynch kind of have a
budding head relationship or have yeah
she felt that
he abandoned the show and that's kind of
why she got
written out i'm gonna [ __ ] kill you
okay
he lost interest because they solved the
murder which is true which is what
happened yeah and so he went on to do
other things and she felt like he
abandoned
the show okay see that that almost i
mean that makes sense then when you
think about the relationship between her
and her writer husband character a
little bit of david lynch in there with
them kind of you know
budding heads and yeah you're the one
that wanted to go
now you're looking like you want to stay
thank
i'd been you more with you but i loved
being here at the beginning of the show
one of the disparate elements that were
just like how does this connect to we're
in new york
yeah and there's this guy he's watching
tv no he's not he's watching a box
but he treats it like he's watching he's
he's watching a vacuous box
it's about he's watching tv he's
watching he's watching current tv yeah
and there's a gal that wants to watch tv
with him begum
and she seems like she's maybe up to
something but who knows that's true
i kind of interpreted as just she's into
him whoever that guy is yeah we don't
know their history but yeah it could be
something else she could be working for
because we find out later that
this whole project with these cameras
and capturing the
the footage of this box turns out it was
kind of uh
the person in charge of it turns out to
be evil cooper we see a picture of him
later
um so maybe she's an agent of the white
lodge she's trying to get in there to
figure out what the hell's going on who
knows could be
i don't know uh we never find out
because the important part that just
like a slasher movie
sex leads to death
but that was a good early indication
that number one we're on show time
yeah we are we are not on regular tv
so we get you know nudity and extreme
gore yeah god and just and but also an
early indication that we're not holding
back
like we're going to see we're going to
see a lot more than we were used to in
twin peaks oh yeah
because that's it shakes you whatever
you know
uh that that figure that might be judy
that might be
evil but whatever it is i assume that
was judy yeah an extreme
negative force called in olden times
zhao day over time
it's become judy
i'm not going to talk about judy in fact
we're not going to talk about judy at
all we're going to keep her out of it
gordon again but it seems like this has
been set up to be like another because
cooper ends up there too
it's like a manufactured stop well it's
like that that spot in the woods and
twin peaks that you
you find that random that spot in the
woods that can you can enter the uh the
red room from
it's almost like another one of those
where it's like this is a
portal to and from wherever these these
other
beans are coming from but so do you
think that evil coop like built that
on a spot like that or did you make it i
well i there's some theories and we can
talk about this but
one of the theories is that evil cooper
is trying to
trap judy or stop judy because judy's
a bigger more powerful evil entity than
him he wants more power
okay um and so the theory is that
uh those two having sex that almost like
conjures up judy like
like like like a jason voorhees what
someone's have sex i gotta go kill him
so the end of the show when we get to
uh cooper and diane they're driving the
430 miles they know once they hit that
they will enter another world right
because then they go to a hotel and they
have sex
and it's very awkward and it's very
uncomfortable especially knowing
what evil cooper did to diane like she
is not happy about this
but it feels like something that they
have to do
once we cross it could all be different
and so the the the interpretation is
that that's them trying to conjure judy
into this world
because this this world that they have
now entered is almost like a pocket
world created by the white lodge created
by the
the firemen to capture judy okay so
that's why they're there that's where
they're headed that's why they're having
sex is to get judy into this world so
that they can trap judy
which is again why they gotta get to the
palmer house at the end because that is
where judy is
that's a theory it's interesting that's
interesting to think about
yeah because well yeah because i mean
they're they're clearly they have sex
and they are not happy about it it seems
like they don't want to be doing it no
they're talking about before like well
what do we do now
yeah like well that's what we do
yeah they're not pleased yeah so that's
the uh i kind of like that the idea that
there's this larger story
going we have the main story with them
trying to stop evil cooper but
in the background there's this larger
story of all these different entities of
like the white
lodge and cooper and the fbi agents and
they're all trying to
to trap judy now the last thing cooper
told me
was if i disappear
like the others do everything you can to
find me
i'm trying to kill two birds with one
stone
two are smart
the idea that they could basically put a
stop to this elemental evil that's
been around since the 50s yeah since the
creation of the atomic bomb which is
kind of
i don't know a representation of like
man-made evil
it absolutely does that's when that's
when things changed as far as what
the horrible things humans were capable
of doing to each other that's fair
and that's obviously that's always been
a theme in david lynch's work
you know the 50s and yeah and evil
and yeah the atomic bomb weighs heavy
you know it's uh behind
gordon in his in his office yes
talk about not subtle
we're talking about uh the series
feeling like the culmination of david
lynch's entire career but
even beyond that he goes full stanley
kubrick for him for a few moments he
sure does and it's glorious
it's amazing it's so beautiful yeah like
that felt that
i've seen they were showing that in in
theaters for a while
yeah around the same time weren't they
really amazing filmmaking the effects
are so good
yeah and just yeah it felt like it felt
like a
yeah like a makeup for all the just like
yeah i know it's been looking pretty
cheap and like yeah and
half of his head's just kind of like
digitally gone and like it looked kind
of weird
the head of the fire of the woodsman is
kinda like i know we've been working on
this major briggs is just like a
photoshop cut out of a face
like i know this is what we've been
doing yeah
and it's so good the roadhouse is proud
to welcome the nine inch nails
in the context of the way we've been
watching the show you know let's have
that structure just like
story story musical act story story
musical act
and this one a little story the nine
inch nails
we're the we're at the yeah the road
house performance already and the show's
the episode's just starting
it's just like oh so we're going to be
doing some things a little differently
here yeah we're already freaked out
because we've watched the whole thing
with the with the woodsman
repairing which is unsettling
wonderfully unsettling and then right
into the
atomic bomb panderecki music again
talking about the music and always
pulling music from different sources
unlike the original show it's not just
the angelo batalenti music yeah yeah and
it's just to me just the slow-mo
zooming right into the middle and
beautiful because there are there is
you know maybe some beauty and
destruction and evil sure
you know that you're attracted to as a
human a little idea that he wanted to
get across
violence is entertainment yeah you're
sarah palmer watching uh
animals rip each other apart on tv as
long as you still have some bloody
miramix you'll be all right
and we opened up just the entire
mythology of the show which i love where
it's like
it introduces new concepts but it
doesn't over explain them
which i wouldn't expect it to really
does explain it was just we're we're not
we're not in like midichlorian
no no you're not giving you're not
giving solutions you're just giving
answers yeah you're given what is this
well it's this
why no and sometimes it's explained very
where it's almost like hard to believe
that people are confused when works like
when dougie
shows up in the red room and he's
talking to mike
someone manufactured
you
what you were manufactured someone made
you for a purpose
and you serve for that purpose there
like
that's pretty clear cut yeah what don't
you get
but yeah the the introduction of i mean
we see the
presumably the white lodge which we've
never seen before
and the the kind of new
position of is the giant and the firemen
the same person
yeah there's a giant from the original
show
now he's called the firemen he's on the
side of good
firemen puts out fire fire of course
represents the the darker aspects of
of uh of the show and of the character
of judy and all that
yeah i mean as far as yeah as far as i'm
picked up he's the same character all
the way through
okay but yeah that episode like
especially its placement in the season
oh it's like yeah because you start
watching the first couple episodes
everything feels so disconnected
and then it very slowly starts to all
kind of like okay
i'm starting to get the hang of where
the show's going and then he literally
blows it up
yeah yeah just like hold on though
if i had a complaint about the season as
a whole is i i don't think anything
after that lives up to that episode i
don't even know how it could
it can't but it's all colored by that
too
yeah you know so there's evil being a
new evil being introduced into the world
yeah you know a whole different evil
something elemental being introduced
into the world
and that's yeah after going full stanley
kubrick then we go full like george
romero we're watching one of the best
zombie movies
that's ever been made even though it's
not a zombie movie no it's just
unidentified evil and everybody knows it
from the second they see him just like
this isn't right
yeah creeps everybody out this is the
water
and this is the well drink full
and the sand or almost like it's
supposed to be like an announcement that
evil has arrived
in the world yeah i mean the fact that
it's happening over
a radio broadcast and so much of the
show is you know
tv related so it's media in general and
the way that all connects
yeah and how news was you know
disseminated most quickly by radio at
that time probably
yeah in part in part of that you know
woodsman sequence
you see that old gas station with the uh
you know the the
the second floor you know you know gas
station also can be
known as a convenience store and what
happens above the convenience store well
that's where mike and bob live
that's where something that was
established in fire walk with me
that's the craziest thing when we talked
about fire walk with me we talked about
that scene and how
it's a great scene but i was saying it
was so like heavily edited and
and like truncated to the point where it
almost feels
weird like it feels like it should have
been cut out of the movie
now turns out that scene is the key
element of this entire thing who'da
thought
it's mind-blowing yeah that idea that he
had these ideas
i highly doubt he had all this planned
out when he made firewalk with me
maybe some of it maybe some of it but
you look at like the woodsman cause
there's one of those
in firewalk with me in that convenience
store played by jurgen brock now but
he's not he's not like covered in sweat
so it's different it's changed
right um but just the idea that this
connects at all
philip jeffries is a huge part of the
season and every
every every seemingly unconnected
sentence that david bowie said in that
scene
every last one of them counts who do you
think that is there
listen up listen carefully i've been to
one of their meetings
it was above a convenience store it's
like who do you think that
is there yeah like that doesn't mean
anything no it does
now it does well even you know i'm not
we're not going to talk about judy
is it the last line of firewalk with me
is the monkey saying
the name judy yeah i mean maybe david
lynch had some of this stuff in mind
back then but
it might have just been because he works
kind of from the subconscious or it's
like the name judy came to him
yeah he had the monkey say it well
that's the thing where you talk let's
talk about catching the big fish or he's
going deep yeah
yeah going deep to get these ideas and
maybe that was just floating way down
you know yeah that he went and retrieves
or something that
uh from making firewalk with me just you
know resonated in his head
and he eventually went back to get it
well that's like inland empire where
it's like that didn't start as a feature
he just started making these digital
shorts
he made rabbits rabbits right and uh you
know a couple of the other little
segments in that movie where it's like
it wasn't meant to be a feature and then
it just like
ideas came and ideas came and then that
connects to this
and it just expands from there yeah in a
way that
makes sense with inland empire because
it was so down and dirty
shot digital cameras like you you have a
lot of room to experiment with that
the fact that this season three has
that level of experimentation while
still being cohesive and being something
that
a major network could produce and you
could have a schedule for
is really mind-blowing we're not on
location where we have to you know that
we aren't we own the stages
you know it just drives me nuts that we
have to do
within two days this is absolutely
horrible
we never get any extra shots we never
get any time to experiment we never get
to you know go dreamy or anything
i could have spent a week in the
firemen's i love that place
and dream up all kinds of stuff you
don't get a chance to sink into anything
it's not a way to work it and you tell
me i got two [ __ ] days to do all
these things there's just bang bang bang
it's like a [ __ ] machine
but uh yeah what's uh what's sarah
palmer up to
after all these years a lot of drinking
but speaking again of tv that's
apparently what she's been doing the
whole time it's just sitting in her
house
drinking and watching terrifying
she's watching her shows well she's
watching violence tv
she's watching yeah there's like boxing
and that boxing is on a loop it's like
the same
minute long thing that just keeps like
repeating over and over
which you know could be a statement
about how repetitive tv shows can be
where
your characters can't learn and grow
because you have to have eight seasons
of them
initially it was always very interesting
to think about because she's
the palmer left in all this fallout you
know as
you know what would this what would
anyone do if they were that person
yeah you know where your your your
husband was raping your daughter and and
they're both dead and and what do you do
yeah
even if you don't believe in you know
bob or anything just like you're still
left with all the emotional fallout of
it
yeah and you're kind of wondering like
you revisit that character 25 years
later and then she's
something's not right
well i think she is inhabited by
if not judy some other sort of
evil form very evil form i don't know if
it's evil
um i mean she doesn't bite a guy's neck
off yeah but that guy's an [ __ ]
won't leave her alone that's true but i
feel like i mean the whole
story of it feels like it's leading up
to that
the palmer house all these characters
the firemen
and the fbi agents they're all trying to
get to a point where cooper is with
uh laura palmer or some version of laura
palmer at the palmer house
and i feel like that's kind of become
the epicenter of judy or of this evil
force
and they have to get there to sort of
defeat that yeah
although when they get there they have
no idea what's happening because they're
now in a different world and they're not
not even necessarily like them anymore
that might not be cooper but there's
yeah but there's this parallel of uh
when hawk goes to sarah palmer's house
at one point
somebody in the house no
no just something in the kitchen you
know sarah palmer comes to the door and
she like looks behind the door
like you hear weird noise and he's like
what's that then then the end that same
thing happens when
uh cooper and uh laura palmer are there
where the owner of the house looks
behind to get answers and
it feels so i feel like that's kind of i
mean the whole idea with the evil forces
is
with garmin bosia that's they're feeding
off of pain and sorrow
who has more pain and sorrow at this
point than sarah palmer
she's had a [ __ ] up life absolutely
absolutely
um and the reason that why i say that
it's it's
not necessarily evil laura is in the red
room and she opens up her face the same
way that that sarah palmer does
yeah so that's really you know what's
what is that connection there
potentially yeah and one of the things
we were thinking during episode eight
when there's the um the the frog bug
yup that comes out of the ground and
crawls into that little girl's mouth
we're like is that gonna be revealed
that that's sarah palmer yeah it never
is it never is in the final dossier it's
confirmed
oh really okay which i don't know how i
feel about the final dossier because of
[ __ ] like that
yeah i i honestly i don't like the
because if that idea is that
this evil or whatever this entity has
entered her when she was a little kid
but that's not evil that's laura because
remember how the fireman
pulls the orb with laura in it and then
uh the woman
kisses it and slows it off yeah so i
think that's laura somehow
the little bug monster yeah or the
spirit of laura or the something that
makes laura happen because
the implication to me there is that
laura is sent off to fight
judy yeah i guess i didn't interpret the
the stuff in the firemen
in the white lodge or whatever like yeah
we see laura palmer's face in the
that orb yeah i don't know if i
interpret that as being
like literally laura or even the spirit
of laura so much as just
we connect with laura because we know
the show so it's more that this orb
represents
the the good that is meant to combat the
darts yeah we're like the or with bob
isn't isn't
actually literally bob yeah that's what
i mean it's just that's how we know them
because we watch the tv show twin peaks
which is why it's being represented to
us
exactly uh again the the good versus
evil
um yeah i think so i i guess i guess i
didn't really think of that
frog monster was being i interpreted as
being something evil and this is like
the start of
the like we talk about with like the
growing kind of like
evil underbelly that's happening in the
world and that's why i say i don't
necessarily like the final dossier
because
i can feel that weight i could feel
either way about that because it didn't
because the reason that that little
girl's asleep is because of the
woodsman's
mantra yeah you know over the radio
so it's like why was she put to sleep is
so that bug frog could get in her mouth
so that seems bad they're bad right they
kill people
yeah and then they fix evil coops like
they clearly are on the side of evil
but yeah so you could could you could
see it either way
you know and that's so the idea that
that's you know would this is the good
being in you know going into sarah
palmer's body
so does it mutate or something and then
at the end that's why she can open up
her face like laura
so yeah that's i kind of that's why i
assume that that
maybe wasn't uh sarah palmer but i guess
the book confirms it for whatever that's
worth
for whatever that's worth because i
because i was thinking about that when
we were originally watching it was like
i don't know how i feel about the idea
that sarah palmer has had this evil in
her throughout the entire like the first
two seasons of the show
yeah that doesn't feel right so it
almost feels like whatever this is has
kind of
taken control of her or taken residence
in her body
after the facts which is why i say like
they feed off of
pain and sorrow where it's like that's
something that's happened later which is
why
she's turned out the way she is now yeah
it's definitely a change
because yeah in the first in the first
two seasons she was an innocent yeah and
she's
clearly not that anymore yeah we don't
know exactly what she is but there's
definitely been a change right you know
not yet just what you know the the
watching the violent stuff
obviously the killing eating that guy's
throat
but little things like whatever she's
trying to do to laura's picture at the
end
well like what we were saying with like
you can't you can't change the past
like you can get rid of this picture you
can try to get rid of this picture but
it's not going to get rid of what
happened to
laura palmer it's not going to get rid
of your pain and suffering
where are we going
we're going home
what coop does does change
it changes the timeline but it doesn't
remove
the pain and suffering somehow yeah
because laura doesn't die
she disappears like they they show it
they show pete going out
to fish and that and the the body just
that's another case
we're talking about like dead actors and
stuff and the way
like major briggs lives on it's so
weird to see pete gets to go fishing
jack nance lives
yeah and that has more of an emotional
weight too
because it is jack nance because of his
history with david lynch and how long
they've
you know same with like katherine
coulson like how long they've all been
working together
yeah yeah yeah but yeah so that's at
least some things have changed
you know maddie probably never went to
twin peaks and so leela didn't get to
kill her
and it's interesting to um the way that
it was set up to where all of a sudden
it's just
uh but just from just from filmmaking
perspective you know we're coops in the
woods
and they were able to cut together so
well
like stuff oh that was yeah it was so
good it was just amazing
oh that's again you're talking about how
david lynch just takes these he has
these ideas these random ideas and then
eventually they connect the idea that
i i don't know what the motivation was
when he made firewalk with me to have
cheerily yell at that moment
it probably was just an emotional like
just scream into the woods
we'll see what we do with it and now
[ __ ] 25 years later
yeah it connects it's amazing
what's wrong lesson by the way to
everybody that's wanting to do this kind
of thing instead of doing the digital
de-aging just put your actor in the
shadow
you don't have to see him real well just
enough to tell that it's the same person
yeah
that's all you got to do don't [ __ ]
around with computers
that whole section like that second half
of that episode when
when cooper enters the fire walk with me
world i i just remember when we were
first watching it we were just like
like i didn't know what to make of it i
still don't know what to make of it but
it's it's it's still amazing just how
well it worked
and why you know why he thought to do
that
yeah you know because yeah we don't we
don't know when when coop goes into that
door we don't know what his plan is
yeah you know he's just gonna go do
something else the literal story of the
show is wrapped up at this point
basically yeah he's gonna go the bob orb
got punched by freddy
we haven't mentioned but i like freddy
for what he's given he's fine but that's
another case of like we were talking
about the uh
the white lodge kind of leading like
dougie
through you know getting them from point
a to point b they show they get them to
the casino which gets them to the
mission brothers and all this stuff
connects
where he's like constantly being led
along and freddie talks about that too i
always like i met
this guy he called himself the fireman
he told me that i had to go buy this
rubber glove and i had to move to twin
peaks
so it's like it's the the forces of good
have been leading everybody to this
this moment for decades yeah and i i i
like that idea that it's like
everything from twin peaks has been
leading up to
where we get at this show yeah but then
after that that's when things go off the
rails
because it's because we're done yeah but
this idea like i was saying earlier this
idea that like
there's the world of twin peaks which we
have
you know at one point david bowie says
this and firewalk with me and then
cooper says this and this we live inside
a dream
it was a dream we
live inside a dream
we live inside a dream
and it's like are they talking about tv
show are they talking about
i feel like it's all the same thing a tv
show uh
you know dreams alternate realities like
i feel like at the end of this when
they're driving through twin peaks
and they get to the palmer house on the
final episode of the show like i feel
like
those characters are now in our our
worlds
yeah not that twin peaks exist in that
world but our reality in terms of like
they drive past the double r diner
it doesn't say like double r to go like
it did earlier in the show like it's
like the real place
so there's things like that and then
like the the actual owner of that house
in real life is the one who answers the
door
yeah so like that's maybe a little clue
yeah so not in like a like a
cheesy like sci-fi tv show like
alternate reality way but like it's all
kind of connected
yeah and the circular nature of the
whole thing yeah
just repetitive you know that even as
much as
in those last couple episodes that
cooper is
either faded to or thinks he can
set everything right that he can
actually go back into the woods
and save laura and everything will be
fine again
which is not the point right like well
that's that again ties into the idea of
like a tv show revival
yeah like you can't go back you can't
you know let it be what it was yeah
and i get it you want answers you want
to try and make cause that ending like
when we first watched it that final
episode ends
and we were all just like complete
silence
i think at one point i find it was like
he pulled another house annie he did
he did but the thing about that for me
is
he gave everybody a conclusion yeah if
you want to stop at the end
you know you know cooper has defeated
evil cooper
and everything's right again you can
stop right there and have a nice
conclusion
episode 17 feels almost like a parody of
or like mocking the idea
such concrete closure to things because
everything's wrapped up and like we
mentioned lucy or she's like
for completely unmotivated she's like i
understand cell phones now
andy i understand cellular phones now
it's like yeah things just get wrapped
up and it's not it's not the only thing
that does either like there's plenty of
satisfying things and people complained
about it you know
the same way they complained about the
end of the second season yeah but you
there's so much
payoff in in season three like
big ed and norma get together finally
that's that's the big
order and it's such a wonderful scene
such again just heartwarming it's just
like they're finally together
yeah like if that's not enough payoff
for you i don't know what the [ __ ]
you know you get plenty of payoff and
then you get to have a little coda
you get to see you know you get to watch
david lynch play with his characters a
little longer
and just see what might have happened
because well and again they're talking
about
you know everybody that uh touches a
blue rose case eventually
something crazy happens they disappear
yeah it's like well that's that's coop's
fate that's what he's got he
can't do anything else he's he must go
into
that door see you at the curtain call
regardless of like how you want to
interpret it and there's so many
different interpretations out there and
some are really interesting
but if you like break it down to what
it means because like when you're
watching that episode
they're driving that whole last episode
they just keep driving
and you know we very we make a point of
showing like there's a gas station like
this isn't big ads this is like
a normal ass gas station in the real
world
somewhere out in wyoming yeah exactly
because they're all yeah
all the way from texas to montana yeah
and so it's like i just remember that
like
sinking feeling where they're driving
and i'm like holy [ __ ] there's only like
10 minutes left
like being so like lost as to where
this could possibly go and it's like i
don't know what's happening but i know
how it's making me feel and it's making
me feel anxious
very anxious
you recognize anything
no
and i think that's the ultimate point
and then you get to that final scene and
my biggest takeaway from the entire
series is
that simple statement of you can never
go home again like we're talking about
you know you can't do a traditional
revival of twin peaks or you shouldn't
let it be what it was
it wouldn't work yeah exactly it
wouldn't work and you wouldn't reboot it
you wouldn't you know do a whole recast
like all that you can't do it you got to
let it
just the story has to continue on from
where it left off yeah that's the only
way to do it
yeah they literally can't go home again
this isn't the same house anymore
no that's not that's not that's not even
laura palmer
yes exactly breaking down the specifics
of like
this symbolizes this and this symbolizes
this and it's all connected to this one
central
thesis it all just seems so boring to me
because that's not really what you're
supposed to be getting out of this
it's about the world and these
characters and the way they interact and
the way they
respond to to darkness or violence or
how they respond to
uh love and affection with you know what
happens with
norman you know big ed at the end it's
incredibly heartwarming that has nothing
to do with
the meta aspect of the show being about
the violence in tv or whatever
and we keep going back to it but david
lynch loves his characters
and watching the there's a bonus disc on
the blu-ray
just it's almost just like fly on the
wall behind the scene stuff and
it's clear not only does he love these
characters but he he
loves and trusts these actors and they
very clearly trust him too
because he doesn't give direction in the
sense of like explaining their specific
motivation for scenes he tells them
how they're supposed to be feeling they
might not understand literally what's
happening but
they get the emotion of the scene which
is what it's all about
yeah and it fits into the it fits into
the overall puzzle that david lynch is
building
you know he knows where it's going to
fit don't worry about it and they don't
yeah you got the key yeah the opening is
there okay
and it's it's getting it's coming you
know closer and closer and that tone is
coming
that that they heard in the great
northern yeah in the boiler room and all
this kind of stuff
and it's coming here in the sheriff
station i was saying for a while that
it's my fa
episode eight is my favorite movie movie
of the last few years
yeah i think now in re-watching the
whole series i would expand that if you
want to call
the return of movie it's it's my
favorite movie of the last decade
there's nothing like it there's nothing
that's been as good yeah
and just yeah it's it's incredible what
about the fbi
i am the fbi
yeah if this was i mean i i honestly
before this series was announced i
thought
david lynch was done oh yeah with at
least with features you know i know he's
he does his music he does music videos
all the sculptures and everything yeah
i'm always doing that but i i really
thought that was
the end of it yeah that was part of the
blessing in the first place yeah that
this even exists
because we just yeah he had done inland
empire and said he was done and
stuck to it for a good long time not
only that it exists but
it's it's 18 hours of new directed david
lynch stuff
exactly i don't know if everything he'd
done up to that point adds up to 18
hours yeah
exactly look the most important thing is
that
josie is no longer stuck in a doorknob
are we sure
why didn't they address that in the
scene god damn it what happened to josie
in the door
well not a doorknob it's like a drawer
what happened to josie
