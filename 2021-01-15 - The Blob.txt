so jay anything interesting happened in
the good old USofA this week
not at all i'm so glad 2020 is over
2021 is just off to such a better start
as we speak right now january 4th
2021 everything's going along smoothly
i mean it i couldn't ask for a better
year i don't know what's gonna happen
tomorrow or the next day you know but
as of january 4th 2021 how much can
change
in two or three days but not much from
today january 4th
and speaking of 2021 this is the year
we promised we'd review the blob and
also not to be confused with the blob
uh the blob the remake was written by
frank dearborn holy [ __ ]
and there's several members of the cast
of the blob that are in the mist that's
coming up
stay tuned 2021 will do that it'll be
competing with avatar six
right i arbitrarily back when we
reviewed the mists i just threw out a
date
a year to review the blob and uh here we
are
i also said that we would be reviewing
avatar six in 2021 and
we haven't even gotten avatar two so
we're more reliable than james cameron
right it's true yeah it's true
anyway it's 1988's the blob yeah which
is
not a film about louis anderson we're
not going to review the original the
blob
we're not going to do a compare and
contrast uh because
we don't care about the original the
blob uh yeah i have not seen the
original
the blob i've seen the original the
thing
and the original uh invasion of the body
snatchers all
of course have famous remakes yes but
don't forget the fly
and the fly yes there's a lot of old 50s
b movies that were remade in the 80s
we complain about remakes now but the
80s really was the time for it
the difference was they were remaking b
movies that
could use an improvement and making them
better yeah yes the only thing i
remember about the blob was
the bowling alley scene when uh
was it or was it a movie theater it's a
movie theater okay that's one of the
holdovers in this is the yeah
where i thought there was a bowling
alley where the strawberry jam comes out
of the wall
they reference it in this they make it
they make two jokes
great i killed the strawberry jam
i think kevin dillon's like he's he he
picks up something on the ground he's
like ah oh yeah strawberry jam
he looks yeah and then they cut they do
a hard cut from the real blob
to someone eating jello a little nod at
the original
shot the hokiness of the original yeah
yeah
it's not just that the original was
because it's i don't know i don't think
either of us are into
50s sci-fi b movies everything's about
communism
everything's about communism but it's uh
they're all very talky there'll be a
couple
scenes with the monster or the threat
the giant ant or whatever it is
and then it's lots of scenes of people
talking in rooms richie you old buzzard
i didn't know you were a chess player
it's like i've been telling you
he seems to think the doctor got into
some kind of trouble here tonight yeah
my daughter mr
dennis thank you for coming out here
all we know is that they told us
the scenes where the blob attacks people
the the four percent of the movie
or or the monster in 50s bee movies
right
those were meant for everyone to throw
their popcorn and scream
the other 96 percent is teens making out
in the drive-in
that's why they have the long talking
scenes yes they knew their audience
oh sure it's come on doll let's go to
the drive-in
i'm gonna show you a spooky movie i
don't like spooky movies
don't worry most of it's boring talking
the most shocking thing in the original
the blob is that steve mcqueen is
playing a teenager
he looks like he's 40 years old
the best thing about the original the
blob is the theme song beware
anyways i love this movie i've forgotten
how much i love it
i you know it's one that i i watched
here and there growing up and i always
really liked
and uh in this recent re-watch i
realized
kind of like when we talked about
tremors our very first review
it's pretty much a perfect movie from a
structure standpoint from a script
standpoint
solid [ __ ] script by frank darabont
yes yes the writer of the mist the green
mile
shawshank redemption of course shawshank
redemption um
uh got his start in horror he uh
this is directed by chuck russell who
directed nightmare gnome street 3
written by chuck russell and frank
darabont
the cinematographer was the
cinematographer of all of david
cronenberg's early movies
we got a couple david lynch cast members
it's the perfect stew
i felt it felt lynchian i think it was
the diner
yeah the it felt uh f
krugerian freddy kruegerian the
the scene where um the girl is taken
home
by her parents and the mom's like here's
a sleeping pill just go to sleep
and you're safe now you know and she's
like i'm not taking your
sleeping pills mom it's a heather laying
clamp
that was a scene that was cut out of a
nightmare on street three so they just
reused it in this
yeah yeah like oh it's a sleeping pill
yeah whatever and she sneaks out her
window and then you got the
the is it's kevin dillon the brother
of matt dillon i assume yeah um as as
the
the the biker punk outcast
he was the most amazing mullet you've
ever seen he was a little like the
the other character from the first uh
neighborhood street
like rod yes rod and who ends up in
prison
so does kevin dillon and then um wasn't
johnny depp sort of like the
quarterback kind of guy like yeah he was
sort of a sportsy guy
right so the main girls yeah of
boyfriend right
and then you have the other guy in this
um although the guy in this gets
dispatched a lot earlier than johnny
right which is worth pointing out when
we talk about the script
this movie does a great job of every 10
minutes or so kind of resetting
and and keeping the story interesting
yeah well it's a
95 minute run time perfect flawless
execution
uh in every regard so i wrote my notes
nope on an ancient form of communication
is that a piece of paper
a paper pepper i've heard of those
uh it is it is printed out on a computer
i originally wrote
with my hand oh i have a little notebook
a spiral notebook
with with lines on it and i use
something called the pen
oh not a pencil but a penine
okay ah it has vague memories of these
things yeah
and i you write with you could you could
create words with your hand
like by the motion that you use a panel
and i did that while watching the film
but i translated it into a computer form
because i can't read my own handwriting
after the fact um
uh but i wrote i wrote all the setups
and payoffs
there's numerous yeah the the most basic
thing
that even wonder woman 1984 forgot to
include
is the basic concept of setups and
payoffs and these are
these are all rudimentary things that we
talk about in all of our reviews
we talk about acts there's acts
there's setups and payoffs and then
there's character arcs
those are your three real big things
that you're supposed to include in a
script
if you want it to work well we should
point out you can
you can't avoid these things you can
break the rules but you have to replace
it with something interesting
and not just jumbled mess of nonsense
like a wonder woman 1984. a famous
author once said
in order to break the rules you must
first learn them
uh and so frank darabon is proving he he
knows
the rules here and he can break them
later in life when he writes
such films as shawshank redemption etc
but uh this he's like i'm playing it
safe
well it's a blob movie this is the
perfect movie to do that with
you know you don't go over the top with
it but
set setups and pass first one motorcycle
jump yes
our hero uh what's his name his
character's name is brian flagg
and knowing that frank derebot's a big
stephen king fan i'm wondering if flag
is a reference to the stand
because that's the main villain in that
movie in that story's name i love all
the character names in this by the way
they're all great um but anyway you got
set up some payoffs first one motorcycle
jump
brian flagg aka kevin dillon i think
they call him flag
he is attempting to jump his motorcycle
over a broken old bridge
because he has nothing else to do yeah
he is the product of a broken household
an alcoholic mother
uh his father left he's turned punk
he's an outcast in their little small
town which is a great setting they show
it
yes and a lovely little matte painting
uh a tiny isolated town challenge makes
it feel twin peaksy
this is a little small town with all
these likable characters surrounded by
the woods
yeah so he's trying to do the motorcycle
jump he fails of course
and then later in the film he has his
chance to do it again
when the stakes are high and he does it
by golly he does it because he's our
protagonist
and then he works in a bike shop fixing
cars a mechanics shop right and they
tease the snow maker machine
uh that his co-worker is chilling sodas
or beers in the snowmaker machine
jay do you remember any other quality
setups and payoffs let me just ask you
this
there's the little kid with a zipper the
jacket the jacket yeah
the mother says you got to take your
jacket i don't want to take my jacket
you got to take your jacket uh my
[ __ ] zipper mom you stupid [ __ ]
that's what he exactly says normally you
would think the jacket would save his
ass
yeah that's the thing that that he slips
out of when he's falling off the
building and but he's able to hold on to
it
but no it causes problems
i also like this isn't really a setup
it's more foreshadowing
which is also important the snow globe
yes um
and of course the whole town is built
around the ski industry
but um uh and it's not even mentioned
that it's christmas time i don't i don't
know i think it's fall
i think yeah they're they're they're
worried about in the coming winter if
they'll be enough to be a good season
but but
uh she's laying in the bed and and next
to her bed is a snow globe
it doesn't show her shaking it up but
the snow is dripping you know what's
going on
yeah you know what they're doing which
is a nice setup for the ending yes
best use of a snow globe since citizen
kane
can i talk about one of my favorite
scenes in the film
that's what we're here to do and how it
could be altered
to make it worse to make it i was
watching the movie and i started
laughing out loud
because i rewrote the movie in my head i
punched up the script in my head
you punched up academy award-winning
frank dervan's script
i did i'm sorry frank so our our hero
paul our temporary hero paul the
high school quarterback who's in love
with meg
and his friend scott jeske go to the
pharmacy scott jeske wants condoms
uh look pal give me a pack of trojans in
a banaca spray
because scott jeske is a potential
rapist
he's not a rape i won't call him a
rapist he was almost he was on his way
he was [ __ ] blocked by the blob he was
[ __ ] blocked by the blob
um he has a he has a bar cart in his
trunk it's kind of amazing
and he has all these like things in
there he and he's like baby you're
wearing my ring
and he has a pile of them in his trunk
he's a dirt bag
yes and um is it implied there that he
put something in her drink
because she gets very sleepy she's not
just like drunk
she like passes out and i was wondering
if the implication is that he was
supposed to have
drugged her i don't think so because
he's surprised when she passes out
okay he's more like like oh an
opportunity
the scene is scott jeske and paul paul
is our hero
he's our he's our all-american high
school quarterback it's the steve
mcqueen of this movie
he's going to make it to the end right
they go into the pharmacy together and
scott jeske the dirt bag goes up to the
counter he's like yeah
mr pharmacist buddy give me um a pack of
trojans and some banaca
uh he goes and he goes to the back to
get them to get them the condoms and
then
the priest shows up i haven't seen you
at the sunday services lately
oh you want yeah well or the regular
it's it's uh it's from a friend over
there and he points to paul who's
completely unaware
yes he's he's he's being duped and the
priest is
you know not you know he's obviously
judging him
you know and then so scott the
pre-rapist
awful sleazy dirt bag pays for his stuff
and leaves
then the pharmacist just said now father
how can i help you
and the father turns to him and says
i'll have one pack of trojans
that's your rewrite that's my rewrite
okay
that's funny so your rewrite is not
restructuring the film in any way it's
just adding jokes
okay fair enough i had a nice joke
i laughed out loud when i thought of
that while watching the film
well congratulations in hindsight i'm
glad they didn't put it in but
yeah this uh the the small town aspect
of it
the priest the religion angle because
the priest gets
once he sees the blob uh he of course
changes his whole perspective yes he's
just a regular old priest and then he
sees the blob and he thinks it's like
i don't know end times and then he
starts his own cult
yeah in the middle of nowhere for
an end times cult and uh that that's
that whole like
the religion the small town
like all the different characters it's
very like the mist
yeah nobody turns on each other but um
and then of course the
the government uh i know the myst is
from a
stephen king book but you have the the
secret
government experiment which added uh
an extra layer on it yeah because you
could go full don dollar and just have
ah just lands from outer space and
that's it
yeah well that's like i was saying
earlier how every every 10 minutes or so
the movie just completely refreshes
itself
because you think like the original the
blob it's a blob it's a creature from
outer space
and this movie sets it up as that so
then you know the the revelation that oh
this is man-made it's chemical warfare
they're doing tests and
then they close off the town so it
doesn't spread and
so and then it's like oh okay that's the
twist which has been done especially in
that era you have like aliens
but then the twist on top of that is at
the head of the that whole organization
he falls into the the sewer
and immediately all the rest of his crew
just turn on him
let's scrag that son of a [ __ ]
it would have been really easy to just
make that entire government organization
all bad guys
right and so the yeah the twists were we
see multiple ones that
feel terrible about what's happened
right one of them by the way did you
recognize one of the
the side scientist guys at this rate by
next week there may be no u.s
you've been watching tim and eric
recently so i thought maybe you would
recognize him
who is he on tim and eric he he just
shows up once in a while because i
always cast these like weird-looking
people yeah he's one of those guys okay
shows up okay
um and he's in this movie he's also the
voice of lord zedd on power rangers
the big muscle red guy he died somewhat
recently but
but he there's a lot of that guys in
this movie
and he's one of them okay another one is
the guy they run into the other
uh guy in the white suit that they run
into in the sewer
where he's got like the crack in his
suit yeah that's bill moseley who's been
in like every
oh yeah bob zombie movie mostly lots of
lots of those guys they got the
projectionist at the movie theater
yeah it's that guy you know hot dogs get
a bad rap
they got a cool shape they got protein
you like hot dogs right
yeah yeah it was just chock full of that
guys well and isn't the pee wee bum in
this
jelly cracker no the bum at the
beginning isn't the pee wee bum
it's another bum it's not the crazed
drunk driver
bum from from back to the future no i'm
surprised buck flower isn't in this
movie so there there's
there's there's actors that make their
career as bums i i swear to god i
thought that was the
jimmy crack corn and i don't care about
them i could see that similar look
you know your bums is it because you're
dressed like one
anyways but going back to the the small
town aspect of it
set up perfectly at the beginning we get
all these great atmospheric shots over
the opening credits
it looks like like the opening of day of
the dead or something where it's like
this town is abandoned
and they're like oh are we seeing the
aftermath of the blob like the movie's
really good at playing with your
expectations like that
and then we see a graveyard and so like
oh
but then we just dolly over we pan over
everyone in the town is at the football
game because it's a small town and
that's what you do
right right that perfect like setup of
of i'm gonna say it's averting your
expectations
and it's funny you should mention that
jay the the graveyard i thought that was
a beautiful visual
graveyard and then you pan over to the
football game
right next door which is
true because out of curiosity
when i see movies like this it brought
back that
um the pit which was filmed in
somewhere in northern wisconsin we
actually drove to all the locations of
the pit
took screen grabs and found where they
shot stuff and i love that
i don't know why i'm fascinated with
movie locations well especially when
it's like a
an unusual location where it's like
there's some small town they don't
usually film at yes
i'm not gonna drive to the joker steps
right um but
uh when it's like just just an oddball
[ __ ] place
where you don't go to film a movie
they're i mean
toronto i mean yeah you find some
background shot in toronto of course
but this is filmed in in abevil
louisiana i don't know if i'm saying
that name right a b b e
v i l l e abboville abevil
very small town yeah um and
so i'm like oh i hit my google maps
and let me grab frames and and i found
all sorts of wonderful stuff the
football field is right next to
the graveyard that's funny because they
i watched the commentary track
and they make a point of mentioning that
that was in the script
so it's like they must have looked for
it yeah like did they find a town
specifically because they wanted one
that had
a football field right next to a
graveyard it's very specific
yeah it wasn't like the location scouted
and they said oh we could do this shot
like they had the idea then it was in
the script
interesting yeah yeah they must have
scoured small town
america to try to find that exact thing
and then they saw like okay well we got
there's like two kind of main streets
right
and there's like there's the courthouse
which is
doubled as the town hall they call it
the town hall
there is an actual police station but
they never
show the uh exterior of the real police
station what they show is like
this red brick building that kind of
looks like a i think it's a bank or
something
when um kevin dillon gets let go by the
police that's where it comes out of and
it's a cigarette
which is right down the street from the
diner which is another main location yes
it's the exterior
where uh the famous
manhole cover sequence happens okay and
there is
an actual manhole cover there yeah the
whole climax of the movie takes place on
that street
yeah yeah the the diner
the exterior of the diner is a real
diner but the inside
most likely a set the inside is a set
and this kind of
we'll talk more about effects in a bit
but what's interesting about that is
it wasn't just because you see there's a
big window and the door is all glassy
you see
across the street and it's not just like
a big uh
like they'll use like a big you know
painting or a backdrop or whatever
it's actually like a half scale
miniature of
across the street so they're doing like
forced perspective so there's actually
some depth to it
yeah which i i've never heard of a movie
doing that before as far as the
the outside of a location like that the
the closest
thing i could think of that's very
similar is
uh the exterior of dana barrett's
apartment building
which is in new york city it's a real
place and then
when they had to do the um the street
coming apart they did that in los
angeles
where they recreated the facade the
front entrance of the building well sure
but that's full scale well yeah they're
doing like a half scale forced
perspective
for just a mundane diner scene is
interesting
and well that and that might be the case
too with um
when the waitress of the diner breaks
out of the window and ends up in the
alley
they show her uh looking down the alley
and she sees a phone booth there
and um that's the famous phone booth
scene one of the most terrifying scenes
in motion picture history
and you see across the street yeah and
it looks like they're real across the
street because
i've i've done this i've taken the two
images
of the google street view and um
uh her perspective down the alley in the
movie
and it matches up pretty perfectly so it
might have been what you said where they
did a miniature
and that ally is on on a set yeah that
could be um or it was the real ally
and then once she got into the phone
booth it just recreated and it turned
into a soundstage situation obviously
because they have to do
all the stuff coming in and yeah the
dummy and the overhead shot is a
miniature dummy uh
which looks pretty good but then uh one
building
i couldn't find was the movie theater
exterior some of that could have been
shot in la i know all the wood stuff was
shot in griffith park
where any any wood scene in any movie
shot in la they shoot in griffith park
yeah although when you watch the movie
you would never really think of
it doesn't look like griffith park like
the way they light it and
stuff it which is worth pointing out we
recently recorded a commentary track for
dungeons and dragons
yes and on that we talk about the
lighting of the woods in that movie
how they just took giant lights and
blasted the trees and it looks terrible
and this movie has that unnatural
lighting
for the woods lots of movies do but it's
it's a lot of it's like backlighting
with fog
it's it's not realistic looking but it
creates such a great moody atmosphere oh
yeah that it completely works
let's talk about the blob the titular
blob the titular blob
um and it's its subsequent path of
destruction which is
which is what you what you pay for at
the box office
and what you don't get from the original
the blob right hey look there's a blob
let's go to room and talk about it for
an hour
so uh the tin can man or the whatever
they call them in the credits
uh aka not the pewee bum uh
lives alone in the forest and he's the
only witness to the
meteorite that crashes yeah um which i
was disappointed in the pyrotechnics
the uh composite shot of the effect
of the fireball going over him was great
yeah but then it it hits
the forest and then it just does one of
those sparks
like you know he likes kind of like
pyrotechnics that you use like
where people are around they're so weak
okay i wanted a
like a big one uh it was a little
disappointing maybe they bought some
fireworks for that scene and just a lot
of them were duds
yeah it was all right but that scene is
one of the few things that's right out
of the original too
with the bum when it attaches to his
hand that's directly from the original
okay one of the few that in the the
movie theater scene
they're pretty much it but the blob is
is just
a disgusting pile of meat
of grossness that that latches on
and consumes and it's pink purplish
which is interesting that makes it stand
out right it's not like brown or green
or something more organic looking right
yeah
human beings find certain colors gross
brown and green for example pink
not so much it could have been blue too
sure yeah you ever see those commercials
on tvj
you know like when they have maxi pads
commercials or diaper commercials
oh yeah or they always use some sort of
blue liquid it's usually blue
it's just like a light blue color like
watch how absorbent this
this maxi pad is diapers and they just
pour
blue because if they poured yellow or
brown
they'd turn off all their audiences yeah
yeah so they pour
like a yeah a color that that isn't
doesn't normally come out of the human
body right hot pink
blue right so the blob is weird grabs
onto the guy's hand
they uh they uh they hit him with their
car they're on the date
and um take them to the hospital
eventually
the blob just consumes the guy
well this is this is the twist they kind
of set up paul as if he's going to be
the hero of the movie and then 20
minutes in he's gone
and it's great too because the blob is
translucent
so it's not just horrifying that this
thing is eating and growing but
we're actually seeing people be digested
by it
yeah and it's incredibly disgusting
right
that is and it's an element of like body
horror to the movie too yeah in addition
to everything else
that's that's uh like clockwork that's
the 30-minute mark yeah like
you know that's when you know you take
that that
right turn and um everything changes
before it's just like well there's a
weird thing on the guy and
but then once that shot when paul is
consumed by it and screaming and his
hand is out
i mean it's it's great yeah like the
effects in it are great and at that
point in the movie i'm like
this holds up yeah that is oh yeah and
they kill a kid
by the way that's yeah going back to
talking about them kind of taking
unexpected turns
didn't expect a [ __ ] kid to die right
now not only die but die horrifically he
jumps out of the water and it's so
disgusting
it's until the blob gets a little bigger
when things there's there's some
wonky opticals and that's just kind of a
result of the time the movie was made in
of course
but all the practical stuff looks great
the blob itself it doesn't just
like we joked about it looking like
jelly or whatever from the original
movie but
it's it's so like sinewy and it looks in
some shots it looks like
almost like muscle yeah like it's hard
to pin down what it is which is great
right but it really feels like it has a
weight to it yeah there's always one
thing at the end that sticks out to me
it's like when the blob is kind of
pinkish
and then it like it's when the the the
snow trucks overturned
then it like splits open and like a
different chunk comes
out yeah like almost like chicken
colored yeah
like it hasn't quite it's like
multiplying and it hasn't quite
changed into the pink color yet so you
don't know like all those little details
where it's
it's doing something that's alien and
foreign and you don't know what it is
it's just gross the the full scale
props even when paul is on the phone i
think he's trying to call
the sheriff maybe he's like green
screened in
on his at at the desk oh yeah when you
see the blob behind there's a miniature
of the
the room it looked it was pretty solid
looking
where i it was really hard to tell that
he was
keyed in there but then it's a darker
scene too later on
goes so when the blob gets bigger it
starts to
look worse and worse unfortunately
there's one shot near the end when the
whole town is in chaos
and someone's running down the street
you just see that tentacle
it looks like a like a 50s movie which
of course the original is a 50s movie
but
but by that point in the movie you're
completely on board with the story
anyway
oh yeah that stuff is a little more
forgivable by that point i mean the big
one of the big centerpiece set pieces is
the
movie theater sequence yeah i love the
setup of that
that the two little boys they want to
sneak in to see
the movies version of a jason movie
which is hilarious
it's like garden tool massacre i think
it's called i don't know but it's like
it cuts to like a guy with like a hockey
mask on
it's not hockey season
everyone's in the movie theater and then
there's a there's an annoying [ __ ]
behind the two kids
talking during the whole thing it's like
yes that's the guy who first gets
sucked up by the tentacles
as the blob has made its way under the
ceiling of the movie theater
which is [ __ ] frightening yeah it
starts off in the projection booth
well we see after the fact because then
the the manager comes into the
projection booth
and you see that yo-yo come into frame
and then we run off yes that's right
now we have a in addition to everything
else we've had you know miniatures
we've had animatronics and uh green
screen or blue screen effects and now we
have just the full-on
puppet of this guy in the ceiling
but that little character trait of
establishing the projectionist with a
yo-yo and then having that pay off where
it's like
all these these little details you put
in to make all the characters distinct
everyone in this movie even the most
minor of characters is distinct
yeah from from things that are written
for the characters to do to just the
casting
everybody's really like memorable
looking there's no it's not a movie full
of generic
pretty people right which so many movies
are now right
yeah yeah it's a small town the little
romance between the sheriff and the
the waitress owner of the diner right
all these little things who that guy by
the way the sheriff was uh
going back to frank darbon he's the guy
that runs into the grocery store in the
mist that says there's something in the
mist
and he's on the walking dead he's like a
frank darbon regular there you go
jeffrey damon i think his name is yeah
all those uh
all those small town characters the uh
i like the father pharmacists daddy i'd
like you to meet my friend paul
ripped i like that reveal that he he was
the one who sold him the cop
yeah the newspaper comes down and he's
another one of
that guy's hey it's that guy you've seen
him in a million things
yep but the the blob the ceiling of the
movie theater
i mean so that's great it was very
gremlins-esque it was
like the center point because they they
burst out into the alley
and then they have to go in the sewer
system
it's one of my only complaints
government scientists
that deal with microscopic biological
weapons
have weapons of war
like bazookas and grenades
maybe they knew that the blob multiplied
in size but
they seemed shocked by it yeah it's a
thousand times bigger than when we first
started
and it's growing exponentially by this
time next week there won't be a country
maybe that's why they brought bazookas i
don't know there was a great moment near
the end when the blob is is wreaking
havoc on the main town square and
the the one guy's got the the vest of
grenades yes
and he and he sets them off the blob
crushes him
and then like three or four shots later
it's almost just in the background you
see the blob there you just see like a
yeah under the blob it's barely even
acknowledged yeah the blobs coming for
him
and flag has the smarts
because they figured out that um the
blob reacts to cold
first teased or set up when they go into
the freezer
and then they start shooting it with
fire extinguishers
but then kevin dillon aka flag
shows up with the snow maker and starts
shooting the the thing
which isn't quite enough so they gotta
blow it up which is the girl who does it
well then we yeah this seems like it's a
little ahead of its time as far as uh
she goes full like linda hamilton by the
end of the movie right
this is pre-t2 it's great too because
you start out the movie she's just like
normal generic cheerleader girl and then
by the end of the movie she's just
shooting this gun
and i like the fact too there's two nice
touches at the end
with her character when she picks up the
the m16
and she's just like she tries to shoot
it yeah
she doesn't know what she's doing and
she doesn't immediately know how to use
it right and then something happens
where it goes off and she goes ahead
and then um she physically sees
one of the government guys he's got that
it's like a
uh like an army green sack it's not a
grenade
like most people know pull the pin and
grenade throat it's like an army sack
and he turns two things on it and throws
it into the sewer
yeah um and it's like a bomb or
something so
they watch the guy do that so she knows
how to do that at the end
when she throws it into the truck isn't
it nice in movies where characters learn
things based on information they've seen
earlier in the film
i i have never shot i've never shot a
gun
or a machine gun
but i'd imagine if i picked up a machine
gun it would take me a couple seconds to
kind of figure out how to work
it yeah unless it was just like fully
ready to go but then when you shot it
you'd be like ah [ __ ] not really used to
how it shoots
yeah yeah and it's like okay little
touches like that give a movie
uh realistic weight rather than just
nonsense yeah well it's also great
because then she has her badass moment
shooting the gun
and then almost immediately she like
trips and falls off the back of the
truck and it gets tangled up on the
the cord it's her first time fighting an
alien blob in a war
okay she's used to cheerleading yes so
she's not good at
this stuff and that's great
can we talk about the the
miniature oh god the snow maker truck
oh there's one shot where it looks like
a toy oh it's so bad it looks like
something
we'd watch out best of the worst it was
actually kind of shocking yeah
considering how good all the rest of the
effects are
it's like they ran out of money at the
end or something because
some of the opticals look really bad
that you can just chalk up to that was
when it was made but that miniature does
not
does not work no yeah you could go
through and
like talk about gosh
all those all the little the that's why
movies of this era are just
wonderful because you know like all the
little tricks
well it's yeah i mean this is we've
talked about this before but like
something like tremors or this or the
thing where it's like
it just uses every possible trick yeah
every trick in the book and every shot
is a different
completely different it's not all just
cg right every shot is like
you have to think about the physics of
this one there's one shot in
when the the the date rapey guy is in
the car
and her face gets sucked in which kind
of looks silly um but it's fine
but then there's a reverse shot where
the blob attaches onto his face
it's like a one second shot but for that
one shot they actually just used gravity
they turn the whole car on its side he's
sitting sideways and they just drop the
blob from
up top so it falls on him but then
everything sideways so it looks normal
and it's just for one you know one
second shot
now it would be lock the camera down and
just add it later yeah have him go oh
and we'll figure it all out right and
we're not against cg
people seem to think when you talk about
how great practical effects are it means
you hate cg
cg is a great tool it should be used as
a tool like everything else should not
be
completely relied upon but those those
shots the the
the waitress in the phone booth
where it starts like seeping down the
sides and then when it just like crushes
her
like you would not get that sort of
weight from from cg
or when the sheriff's deputy gets broken
in half
sucked into the like there's something
to say about
even if you know it's a dummy there's
something to say about the
horrific nature of of things like that
happening to human beings
oh yeah well that's like i said earlier
body horror there's elements of that in
this movie
like when when uh what's-her-face's
mother got sucked through the door in
neighboring elm street wow yeah yeah
that's the case
well no i was gonna say that's the case
where cg might have worked better but
they did something like that at the end
of the remake
of nightmare on elm street and it wasn't
better no well maybe it was better but
it still sucks just in a different way
yeah i think i just like the the
the cleverness of how do we do this
often works great but then
then the the flip side of that coin is
that they have limitations
sure and sometimes the limitations just
look really bad
like the the keyed in miniature of a
blob coming down the street
and people running in front of it some
of some of that stuff doesn't hold up
but in my opinion i really don't care
i i think it's i think it's a fun movie
that
uh with with a great cast yes a great
variety of characters and like you said
every 10 minutes
it's refreshing itself they go there you
know there's a football game there's
there's
there's the diner there's the the
dynamic between the the sheriff and the
waitress
then you have the the high school
football player and they go on the date
and they end up in the hospital with the
bum
and then they're at down in the sewers
and
all these different set pieces wonderful
things you could do
they did everything they could with a
giant
blob creature infesting a small town
and there was there was no down time
let's like you mentioned don dola
earlier
where it's like a don dolar movie it's
like oh there's an alien in the woods
we're going to be in this woods for the
rest of the movie and characters are
just going to be running around the
woods
it's not that i mean this is this is a
real movie
made by made by real people it's unfair
to compare it to don dolar but
but there i mean there are lots of other
movies even higher budget movies from
that era where that's kind of all it
ends up being
where it like it could have easily done
this where it is just an alien
from outer space and then that's it the
fact that they keep finding new
clever ways to to keep the story
interesting yeah and
and the uh the frank darabantish uh
who who is the real monster here um
uh subtext that that seems to be in a
lot of his stuff
where it's the us government versus the
town really at the end
yeah which leads us jay
to our delicious sequel tease that never
happened
the lord will give me a sign it works as
its own thing even without a sequel
there was talk i want to say it was like
10 years ago
there was talk of a like a reboot remake
just whatever a new version of the blob
uh talk of having it be directed by rob
zombie who's about the worst possible
choice
you could pick for a blob movie
unless you want every character in your
blob film to be a redneck that's all
screaming at each other
this is where i would be a proponent of
of
cg at least in in large scale stuff
because um i would it's like when we
talk about gremlins three yeah
and i think and was it joe dante who
said recently like if they did a
gremlins three buttery puppets
someone said recently that if and when
it happens it's going to be a
combination of
puppets and using digital trickery to
erase the puppeteers which is what i've
always said you should do
keep them as puppets the puppets are the
charm yeah and i think they
they said like it's a similar situation
where the charm with the blob
the charm with the gremlins are the
physical
props or puppets up close like the scene
where
uh the quarterback kid gets consumed by
the blob
like a full-scale prop that's like he's
stuck under and dying
it's [ __ ] horrifying yeah and then
like like just the little
tentacles or chunks that are grabbing
onto people
like they look real they're gross
they're made of
lake latex or something um
but then when you have like you need the
blob to like
burst out of a second story window and
spill out onto the street
um that's where the effects in this
movie get iffy yeah but
but nowadays if you have a good fx
company
like you could probably pull that off
completely realistically without it
looking terrible oh yeah and then like
the case of gremlins
like a shot where there's hundreds of
gremlins like crawling up a
skyscraper or something from afar yeah
cg fine with that um but when you start
it off small
i want to see that little disgusting
thing in a jar
a little booger pulsing yeah
and you do you could do a beautiful
remake or a sequel
with blending both of those two um
applications or those two ways of doing
movie making practical
with the cgi although i think if they
remade it today it wouldn't be called
the blob
because that title sounds too silly and
this movie
is is the perfect balance of kind of fun
light-hearted adventure stuff and
horrific
violent blob stuff but the title itself
sounds funny
so i think if they were to do this today
they wouldn't call it the blob they'd
come up with some new name
i just think more generic i disagree
with you yeah yeah
i would call it the blob [ __ ] yeah
because that's what it is
and it's a disgusting blob it looks like
no motive no no mind no decision making
just to consume and grow and that's it
and that's one
that's one thing that they better not
put in the [ __ ] remake it's thinking
it's getting smarter it's getting
smarter as it gets bigger starting to
formulate plans
let's hit it with the [ __ ] snow
makers again
they bring kevin dillon back the same
haircut
68 years old he's a biker
he's got a maga hat on
and then they start shooting it out and
it backs up it's learning
that's when you cut to black and you
have the voice going it's learning
oh god is that the trailer your vision
it's a trailer i'm visualizing yep
helicopters
take it
