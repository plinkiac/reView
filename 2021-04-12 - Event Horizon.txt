why did you bring me here today jay
i was sleeping
oh i'm sorry
well mike we're here to talk about a film uh it's a little bit different uh than what we normally do on a review
normally we talk about something that we have a long history with or we've seen a bunch or something we like or that we really like
yeah
why are we here
why did you drag me here
uh i don't know
uh we're talking about event horizon
i i feel like you might be in the same boat as me but i feel like my history with this film is similar to a lot of people's
which is i saw it a long time ago and i remember it being pretty good and i never saw it again
well we're we're talking today because there there is a new newly released blu-ray of this
that's what that's what kind of spurred the idea of
yeah
released by scream factory
and none of these companies send us blu-rays and say do a video on it and
we'll give you
we'll give you a we'll give you five
bucks yeah
it never mainly this video will prove
that because i have nothing but bad
things to say about event horizon
really and i will say well not nothing
i have a couple good things to say but
my experience is completely different
oh don't do this
and i watched event horizon and i
thought
and then i thought oh jay wants to talk
about event horizon
it's a newly restored 4k transfer
from the [ __ ] film print i'm like
i think i should like this movie it has
all these elements in it
that i really should like and i watched
it again
and now it is time
to go back i know and my opinion was
identical
okay what it was over 20 years ago
it's it's the perfect type of movie that
should get a remake
no because it's it's a cool premise it's
a terrible premise
so you hate it too it's core this is
interesting
literal one it's it's i think
the the not the first film by paul w
s anderson it's his third film yeah he
made a
famous movie in england called shopping
uh i think i saw that once yeah where
they're like smashing cars and
storefronts and it got banned in britain
and it was like
and then um and i think this might have
been his first like big american
well no before this what got him this
job he did the mortal kombat
film
which is a movie that people pretend to
really love even though it's awful
that that's like like that's like total
nostalgia
i liked it when i was a kid so i still
pretend to like it
it's okay to not like things you liked
when you were a kid true
uh okay so yeah uh this this this film
contains
every element of some something that i
love science fiction
horror neats
faster than light travel concepts
science fictiony concepts
you know gateways to other dimensions
but i think when you put it all in the
proverbial blender and
put put it into a movie it just doesn't
work
and i don't know if it's the direction i
think i think a lot of it is the
characters i just hate every character
it's
yeah and i think that is probably
contributed to the direction
um because these are all talented actors
in the movie wait
i'm just going to stop you right here
because i i i wrote down some if i were
a movie critic
in 1997 i would have said these things
like james cameron's aliens but
sucks like the shining in
space but sucks
like literally the shining in space
yes hopeless miserable dark depressing
unexciting morbid and dull that's what's
on they put on the poster yes those are
all your
like one word critic variety says dull
i do believe it was critically banned
when it came out oh yeah no it was a big
flop
i don't remember reading the reviews but
i don't think it did very well it was a
big flop
it's one of those movies that yeah it
kind of flops in theaters i don't know
if it played on cable i don't know how
people
because it has this reputation of being
like oh i remember seeing that it was i
remember it being pretty good
so i don't know where people saw it
because i don't think it did well in the
theaters it was on cable a lot
why someone would have a good memory of
it i did
and there's still a lot i like about it
i'm not nearly as negative about it as
you are but i think
when we're talking about what doesn't
work i think a lot of it comes down to
the direction
it's paul w s anderson's best movie
which isn't saying much
but i think i think he is the problem uh
because the characters uh you have
characters from different movies all in
this one movie
the cooper character starts out kind of
like a normal human being but as it goes
along he feels like someone that dropped
in from a michael bay movie
yes michael bay loves his his sassy
black side characters
for some reason and that character is
right out of one of those movies to the
point of him being like
an embarrassing stereotype look you can
kiss my ass smith cause i'm done
speaking of cooper it's good to know
that workplace sexual harassment is
still well
and alive in 2047.
it's worse than ever about you stock
would you like something hot and black
inside you
is that an awful it is not yeah the
thing's kind of going waves so it
probably went away for a little while by
the time we get to
to 2040 it'll it'll be back then it was
okay to tell your female colleague
you want something hot and black inside
you yeah
see so you have stuff like that that's
in complete contrast of the more that's
the 90s
like well that's that's the thing that's
frustrating to me about this movie is
that the the stuff that i like about it
is the more atmospheric
kind of them wandering around the ship i
like the production design of everything
it's a little ridiculous but it's cool
that's what i don't like
oh my lord and and this is i think this
is where we differ
because you you you have their little
rescue ship right
the uh it's called lewis and clark yes
which has no
thematic connection to the real lewis
and clark other than they both went on
an expedition
the vent horizon makes sense because
that's the outer
part of a black hole um but real quick
the premise of the movie is there's a
spaceship called the event horizon
and it has developed a way to travel
faster than light
and these are all the things that i like
this is basically
uh sort of like a warp drive sam neil
takes a
a pinup a non-pornographic
of naked ladies stuck to the wall in a
workplace environment
um and he says you basically you know
you fold space-time
and it's a pencil through a pencil
through it and an unforced christopher
nolan completely ripped it off for
interstellar
it's the exact same explanation um
yes christopher nolan i understand is a
big fan of paul w s anderson
right for those of you who don't
understand you can't go faster than the
speed of light
according to einstein's theory of
relativity time
stops when you hit the speed of light so
in the universe exists something called
time
space and it's basically like a fabric
right you can't go faster than the speed
of light so what you have to do is
warp the fabric of space-time
you never go faster like the star trek
enterprise
that spaceship in the show
star wars the star trek
so he says we're going to proxima
centaurian and we're going to fold time
in space
but he accidentally opens
a gateway to hellraiser
specifically hellraiser not hell
hellraiser
we have such sites to show you
let me show you right it's something
that's worse than hell
and it's another dimension yes this is
when it gets a little lovecraftian
yeah lovecraft we got hellraiser a
little bit
alien right and i get i get the
see see the thing is like the lewis and
clark looks like a grungy
disgusting weird spaceship and then when
you get on
the event horizon it's like a
art deco h.r geiger painting
and i i totally get the decision
if you're making a horror movie in space
the ship should be scary
and that's like the logic sure but to me
it was like confusing of
who what was on what ship but there's
something and it was similar to it
oh i see i love the production design of
it i think it's perfect for this type of
movie but it's more than just
that it's grungy and gigger-like like
apparently they they based it on
because there's obviously kind of
religious a little bit of religious
themes in the movie and they based it on
the
the uh notre dame cathedral okay like a
church cathedral yeah
yeah so that's why it has that long part
in the middle it's supposed to be like
the hallway and then
the the cheese grater tunnel
looks like a meat grinder to me the
rotating spherical thing
okay the professor x uh cerebro room
whatever it was that has giant spikes
for no reason which nobody gets impaled
on
doesn't that lady she falls and she hits
the ground and blood splatters
everywhere but she doesn't get impaled
on one of those spikes
that seems like a missed opportunity it
really does it might be a deleted
scene this is apparently notoriously
this movie was cut down a lot but
release the anderson cut they could they
can't though and that's a whole other
story we can get into
oh well i'm glad you did some research i
did a little bit of research because
zero you finished the movie
i guess that's right right but the the
thrusters are like the the towers of the
notre dame cathedral turned
kind of sideways okay so there's a
little bit of religious imagery
a little more to it than just trying to
make it look grungy and scary
spoiler alert was sam neil
like a weird satanic worshiper or did he
get co-opted by the evil forces i know
he was somehow
maybe trying to bring his dead wife back
to life
yeah he was hung up on that i i think
the implication and maybe this was lost
in
trimming the movie down i think the
implication is was that he was on the
ship originally because he says like i'm
already home at one point
and i don't know the details of how he
ended up back on earth
but the implication to me is that he's
already gone through the wormhole or
gone through the black hole
and that's why he's all well wouldn't
that have been neat part if they saw him
in like
the crew log footage that would have
been cool like he's in the background
they freeze frame and he's like
yeah you'd think he would bet on the
maiden voyage it treats it as if he was
and that's why he's crazy now
yeah so it's it's a little murky there
yeah
but that when they're looking at the the
crew footage that leads to one of my
favorite
unintentional laughs of the movie
they're seeing all these horrific images
the the captain like
pulls his eyeballs out he's holding him
up to the camera
and the the comed the timing and the
comedic timing of
lawrence fishburne shutting off the tape
and just going we're leaving
we're leaving i i wrote that down in my
notes actually
oh yeah that's not unintentional i think
that was
would you think that one was intentional
there's some stuff in this movie that i
wasn't sure
it was it was sort of like connecting
with the audience like yeah we're
we're leaving okay i laughed out loud
and i'm sure most people did
i think it was intentional all right the
unintentional case points to them for
the intentional comedy in that moment
right
i left at the unintentional comedy
several sound effects
like by the end of the brothers by the
end of the movie it's like the the
uh whoever was mixing the audio just
gave up
because that fight scene was sam neil at
the end those stock
punch sound effects it's not just that
they're stock sound effects it's that
they're like right in the forefront of
the soundtrack
it's they're so comedic-sounding
well and like the part where uh sam neil
he's
gouched out his own eyes and he has the
space
uh nail gun i don't know what to call it
and he shoots it through the window and
then like you know the space vacuum
starts sucking everything out the window
and
like all the props that are flying
around and i just
i just picture
like wacky sound effects because it kind
of looks funny
yeah that it's it's weird because the
first half of the movie really takes its
time
it has stuff that doesn't work but it's
it's more atmospheric and it's kind of
building
building that that you know that tension
and then at a certain
point i think it's right around the
point when the cooper character
he's launched off into space and he's
like i gotta get back to the ship
i'm saying all these things out loud so
the audience understands what's
happening
think think all right all right all
right i get back to ship i gotta get
back to this ship all right
all right i gotta blow my air tank i'll
blow my air tank
these lacy goes oh damn how do i keep
finding myself in these situations yeah
and it's like all it's like the movie
just like gave up
[ __ ] what the [ __ ] am i going why is
this [ __ ] gonna happen to me
[ __ ] but it's really weird yeah because
i like a lot of the stuff leading up to
that and then tonally it goes off the
rails
that guy that guy cooper
should have died 10 times over that is
not the character that makes it to the
end of the movie it's a really weird
decision well he
he's like i'm gonna blow all my oxygen
out of my
like the movie is fairly like
scientifically
accurate to its best ability at that
point but then he's like
flying through space towards neptune in
a little spacesuit
like hoping that he could make it
back to the event horizon which i think
was in the atmosphere
like how the yeah because when he starts
shooting back towards it
it's nowhere in sight it's that far away
i i
i think it was like in the upper
atmosphere
and like how the [ __ ] is he going to
accomplish that and i think they had to
put in the atmosphere so they could get
away with spooky lightning storm
because that was something i was
thinking about you don't have lightning
in space but i guess technically they're
in the atmosphere
right so that's fine they justified that
but yeah him shooting back i know that
happens in gravity
right but she's using a uh fire
extinguisher to kind of shoot herself
yeah
and and it's like that's the point of
the movie gravity is that they're
flying around trying to figure out
problems like in this situation this
this like nightmarish horror movie and
then you come up with this like almost
looney tunes-esque logic of him flying
around
and on top of that his performance and
he's like i'm coming back [ __ ]
oh yeah it's cringey
it's weird it's weird it's it's uh
it's completely at odds with the the
nightmare hellscape vision
stuff yeah which is the stuff i like so
i i don't know it's all over the place
it's an interesting movie
well i think the nightmarish hell kind
of gross out stuff like the
i don't know what whatever character was
disemboweled and those guts are dumped
out
was that jason isaacs that happened to
you yeah um
like i know that's your thing uh you
like gross
like horror movie stuff it's not as
gross it's a striking visual
yeah there i mean there were some like
legitimately
i think the best scene in the movie is
when justin
baby bear they call him baby oh yeah the
actor's name is jack noseworthy jack
noseworthy
who was in some stuff in the 90s he
completely vanished
yeah he was on a show called um dead at
21.
oh wow yeah do you remember that in the
mtv show yeah and um
i i used to laugh because i would call
him
jack earworthy or jack lipworthy
the man has a fairly undistinguishable
nose
that's true but his name is jack
noseworthy and so i always thought that
was funny
and then i didn't hear about him after
event horizon yeah but that part where
he
he's like possessed or traumatized or
i don't know what the hell scared by
hell and he goes into the
the room the going out into space room
yeah
and uh and then he realizes oh my god
and then they depressurizes and
then they have to rescue lawrence
fishburne has to fly in and rescue him
yeah and his like blood is like shooting
out of his mouth and his eyes and like
like that part was legitimately well
done intense and
but no i like that sequence for the most
part there was like a legitimate like
real world slash horror world
interaction
like that character was doing something
under
the possession or spell of this evil
yeah that he didn't know he was doing
and then he snapped out of it at the
last second
and then it's like oh that con that
those two things work together yeah
he put himself in the airlock and he's
gonna kill himself
because he's he's so scared of this
nightmare land
and then he realizes like what what the
[ __ ] am i doing in here help me help me
he's like helping them
what is going to happen to me because of
the cold vacuum of space yeah
horrific yes and then but then the other
things where it's like oh
you know spooky spooky images
ladies son oh i like that too
she she felt guilty she had to leave her
son behind with her i guess estranged
husband she calls her
her ex they'll have no she's in a
wheelchair and so she sees visions of
him where his legs are all [ __ ] up
like it's like a like a haunted house
movie in space
which you have which contrasts something
like alien which is
more realistic or like monster movies
yeah it's a monster that's a monster
movie in space this one is like a weird
kind of clash between like science
fiction real
like science and supernatural
stuff and i don't know that interests me
it's oil and water
those two things that's what drives them
mad these are scientists that are now
dealing with with these uh
they're not scientists they're emt
people
okay that's true i'm your best friend
okay i'm the lifesaver
and the heartbreaker he's a rescue
technician this is peter's medical
technician and my pilot
mr smith i i'm trying to think of a
movie that
compares hellraiser in space
it is a better hellraiser in space movie
than the real hellraiser in space movie
space is scary enough i think that's why
the airlock scene is so
memorable to me you understand what
happens when
yeah because just the reality of it and
then that
is that kind of stuff was completely
you know deflated when cooper's flying
around in a
in a jet pack yeah towards neptune in
the middle of
the [ __ ] solar system all the stuff
with him
probably die from radiation from [ __ ]
neptune
when sam neil's like eyes are plucked
out and he suddenly looks like a
cenobyte and
uh cooper's coming back towards the ship
and he hits the glass
he's like oh [ __ ] yeah he just happens
to land right outside the front window
of this gigantic spaceship
and then his reaction too is like yeah i
i
it's i don't know it's it's it's the
paul w
s anderson schlock yeah which
carries on to all those resident evil
movies and all that kind of stuff
this is borderline experimental this
makes no sense at all
which is why uh i mentioned earlier
there's apparently a longer cut of this
movie
that was more horrific it was like 30
minutes longer
that part in the end when sam neil's
like let me show you these visions or
whatever and there's all those quick
flashes
apparently all that stuff was more drawn
out you saw more of it
and they had to cut it out to get an r
rating
so there's there's talk people talk
about like oh if that stuff was back in
it'd be a better movie it's like no you
still have that
cooper character that's out of place you
have all these weird tonally
inconsistent things
i don't think more gore wouldn't save
the movie
no and it wouldn't make it scarier
conceptually to me
yeah i don't know like i described it as
the shining in space
uh one part in particular
the blood part oh yeah but also this
like
you know abandoned haunted ship
is similar to the hotel and you know
there's the the divisions
uh nightmarish visions and sam neil
character is very similar to the jack
torrance character
yeah i don't know there's there's a lot
of similarities but i think when your
horror is grounded in
our own reality that we could relate to
hell
and and spaceships just
don't work oh see that's the stuff that
did work for me i can't i can't describe
the idea of like again going back to the
shining where it's like all these
horrific things happening in this hotel
but
a party you know like is thinking about
the fact i mean they have the excuse in
the movie why they can't leave because
there's a storm or whatever but
it's like oh they could conceivably get
out of there
when you're in space you have nowhere to
go
i think it's just our tastes i mean we
can both agree that the movie's not
scary though
oh okay good you weren't under your
blanket going like this no no no
i'm talking about like conception that's
why i say it would be a perfect movie
for a remake because there's
a lot of the concept stuff i think is
interesting it's just
the paul w s anderson schlocky execution
that really uh kind of ruins
it i don't know if i would have executed
it differently
i was trying to think if if the
spaceship
wasn't designed so like if it just
looked like
a regular spaceship yeah and then
you have contrast would be that
juxtaposition would
would make it creepy well i believe the
the original idea for the room with the
the black hole what do they call it in
the movie it has a name
the we'll call it the the warp something
engine they call it
um gravity quantum singularity they
create the quantum singularity is
another
name for a black hole right i don't know
what they call it but that room i guess
the original
idea was to make it more kind of minimal
almost like 2001 like and the black hole
is always
open and that's what fuels the ship and
for
i think partially for budgetary reasons
but also to try and make it look
spookier
they made it into the more yeah it looks
like a medieval torture device
yeah they they kind of went in a
different direction partially for budget
but also i think
because they're like well we got to make
it look like a horror movie exactly
and that's that's the big gamble yeah is
is like
yeah okay the the warp core device looks
like a medieval torture
it looks like a medieval weapon or
something and the hallway leading to it
is this
spirally spiky nightmare yeah and it
looks like that looks like a fun house
corridor and yes it looks spooky
they gave a scientific reason for why
that is there though is something to do
with the gravitational wall or
whatever yeah they give some
gobbledygook right but
we're talking like producer production
design
speaking like do you you make it look
like a regular spaceship
and you roll the dice that people will
be scared by the
theoretical stuff the black hole leads
you to an alternate
dimension that's filled with nightmares
in hell
is that scary enough or do you double
down and
add extra scary on top of scary and make
your spaceship look
like a horror movie see that's why i
thought from the beginning
sam neil was a satan worshiper who's who
who created the spaceship because he
secretly theorized that he could open a
gateway to hell
and he wanted to do it almost like the
building
in ghostbusters designed by
uh not viggo that's the second movie i
want to say vigo the carpathian who is
the architect
the architect's name was evo shandor i
found it in tobin's spirit guide
ivan shandor yvonne
everyone out there give jay a round of
applause thank you evo
is it evo shan no the architect's name
was evo
shandor ivan chandor yvonne shandor have
evo
something chandor yeah yeah yeah you had
like a weirdo name right
yeah he designed the building to be
a lightning rod to open the dimension
once
zul is ready to right and people won't
know what he's up to
because it just looks like a building
yes exactly so that's why i thought the
build
the spaceship event horizon looked so
creepy
was and has his [ __ ] roman numerals
above the
the warp engine but it i don't know
other than roman numerals are old
which has no place on a spaceship and
and why is your
you know who's speaking someone was
speaking latin
demon that was something i wanted to
bring up is they're playing back the
recording
yeah they're like we have this recording
of the the crew the event horizon we
can't figure out what it means
and it's like they had a whole team of
scientists and researchers all looking
no none of them could figure it out then
this one crew member's like
oh it's just latin well nobody knew
it was like somebody in in this team of
scientists
and people on earth well they probably
could have used a computer
to scan it and the computer would
probably figure it out but
you know it lands an old lane it's a
dead language well sure people
know it but my question is why is the
demon
from an alternate dimension speaking
latin that's
a spooky language from earth yeah latin
is spooky it's in all the horror movies
because it's ancient
right and it's it's it's the biblical
times like a language that's a dead
language so when
you know someone who's possessed by a
demon speaks latin
you know nobody [ __ ] knows latin some
people do really smart
people learn dead languages and speak
them but
like you know some possessed 12 year old
girl
isn't going to know fluent latin that's
certainly then a demon
speaking through her right because
that's spooky so why is a demon from an
alternate dimension speaking latin
i don't know because is it really the
hell
from biblical hell that exists
we don't know a lot of unanswered
questions jay
like why did they make this movie
we're leaving
i really like the the design idea to to
align the
the connecting tunnel that separates the
the warp drive part of the ship from the
the crew part of the ship with
explosives
not only that but big uh signs on them
that say
explosives like
couldn't they just decouple it
you know like you know you know train
trains have those like
you know oh yeah yeah and they go like
this or the idea if you
have to detach you can detach yeah yeah
they just
you just like hit a button and it but
that's again that's the the paul w s
anderson action schlock where it's like
that's the decision being made
is to make it because then you can have
a big explosion oh yeah i know why
they're there jay
which is interesting why those bombs are
there between the explosion and then
lawrence fishburne's character
has uh he's has this fear of uh
a crew member that he left behind to to
burn alive
and that that's kind of his his fear
that that's what's haunting him
throughout the film
um so there's lots of fire related stuff
and
which is interesting that the the shape
of the ship or the design of the ship
was
based on notre dame because there
famously was a fire a couple
years true that's true uh are you saying
the movie caused that fire i'm saying
it's it's the movie is it's one of those
what they call a cursed film
oh okay okay do you think someone
like was playing the movie like in notre
dame
like while they were doing the
construction and the the dvd
sparked and caused the notes
i'm saying that's exactly what happened
that that now that would make that would
take your theory a little step
further was watching uh i was watching
an event horizon and they
burned down the [ __ ] cathedral
that's my french accent okay i guess it
is that what that was watching this
you're doing italian me yeah i i you
tend to still
stray towards italian i was just
watching the dvd
of the event horizon the worst film i've
ever seen
and the
dvd player started on [ __ ] fire
because it's 100 years old
i got the disc and a thrift store for a
cent
a french scent then the fire spread to
paul w
s anderson's house in los angeles
i don't know how this happened did i
conclude talking about the the
the missing footage it's kind of
interesting no
uh so the footage was cut to get in our
rating
and uh apparently it was being stored
in a romanian salt mine all the original
footage that was cut
because they you know it's like in uh
day the dead they have those salt mines
underground
and they talk about storing old film
prints yeah george lucas
stores his uh his negatives in the salt
it's a thing the salt is uh is it
absorbs moisture yeah so so for for
whatever reason it was an assault mine
in romania
okay or i think i think paul w sanderson
says it's in transylvania but whatever
uh is it spooky because it sounds spooky
or i don't know he doesn't talk about
this as if it's a spooky thing
but that's where apparently all the
stuff that was cut for the movie or
maybe even the original negative was
stored
and it wasn't stored properly and it all
just deteriorated
so it doesn't even exist anymore
so even if you wanted to do an uh
extended cut
you released the anderson cut the the
material just doesn't exist anymore
that's just the horror stuff or just
everything i think it's just everything
that was cut
which was primarily the the more
horrific stuff the violent
not the original camera negatives i
guess
i mean there's a the negative that they
scan the new print from
right it must just be the cut material i
don't know
you know what that sounds like to me jay
it starts with bull oh and it ends with
it
you think he just went to the studio and
said i want to do an extended cut
and they said ah that doesn't exist
anymore and then he made up the
transylvania part i think they told him
that
oh we put it in a transylvanian salt
mine
we were storing it in the notre dame
cathedral and it caught on fire
dracula's watching over it paul
oh he is he's taking real good care of
it
so yeah event horizon uh
i think i don't know if some people look
back on that like you mentioned mortal
kombat and how people like
like that movie now and it's just
because it's pure nostalgia and it's
like complete
90s dated 90s schlock yeah and there's
elements of that in this
but not enough where the movie is just
like really funny
no are really like entertaining because
it's dated
it's it's like a like a weird it falls
between the cracks
it's not enough of that it's not enough
of the the genuinely kind of atmospheric
stuff
which i think is there and i like um but
that's completely
counterbalanced with cooper floating
through space
yeah insane i'm coming [ __ ]
a splash here and there of
bad decisions and like cringy stuff
but overall um
i don't know maybe like someone who's
a little bit younger than us may have
seen this when they were
younger ish creeped out by some of them
creeped out
and it kind of sticks with them kind of
like me and rawhead rex
one might not find rawhead racks
particularly scary today
but i have fond memories of watching it
on tv and
scared as a little kid i don't know and
that you know and
of course but i can recognize today that
raw head rex is silly
uh and so i don't know i i really i have
not heard anything
online or i i do these people exist that
have
nostalgia for event horizons i think
people like it
but like i said at the beginning i think
people like it because they remember
seeing it a long time ago and remember
it being creepy and we're here to tell
them they're wrong we're here to tell
them that they're wrong
i think conceptually i think it's an
interesting idea and i think
the movie would have been great if it
wasn't for the movie
it's one of those yeah there's a lot i
like
but i can't fully recommend it because
it doesn't
work as a serious horror movie or as
dated
funny 90s movie no it's sort of like an
interesting anomaly i guess it's almost
worth seeing for that
in my opinion it's something that
doesn't really work but has a lot of
interesting ideas
has a lot of things that are interesting
because they fail so badly
um you get the the dated 90s techno
music
at the end just at the very end at the
opening credits kind of and then at the
very end
this is my closing statement
it's got a lot of things that i should
like
the the the space-time black hole
science fiction horror kind of stuff i
do like horror movies you know not as
much as you but i do like them
that kind of creepy idea of
i mean and i you know why you know i
like my ghosts and my demons and my
hauntings
i love love haunted i love gothic horror
there's a little more grungy than that
it's not that classy no
this is more about madness which is kind
of more my interests
uh sam neil right around the same time
he did this he did in the mouth madness
the john carpenter movie a much better
film about
going crazy right um but
but it has that element which again is
the kind of lovecraft thing of yeah
seeing things beyond the hue that the
human mind can comprehend
yeah so yeah and i i like all that stuff
i just think
all the elements put together don't work
it could be their choice of
of what characters to have in the film
and why
why like they were search and rescue
people
it could have been the situation in
alien
where they're space truckers who are
diverted off course to go
do a thing that they're not usually
meant to do yeah
maybe throw a religious uh character a
chaplain aboard the ship who has a
special insight and to hell and uh
i don't know i think it would have
benefited from more there's like some
very minor kind of religious stuff in
this like it could have used more of
that
yeah but all the characters were like
the space marines where they were all
basically the same character they were
all like emt
or medical related personnel
so they didn't have a
you know array of different types of
people that horror effects differently
yeah a diversity of motivation right so
you have your cynic
you have your religious chaplain you
have uh i don't know
like a kid throw a kid on there
uh no don't throw a kid on like a doctor
keep the kids out of horses kid with a
skateboard and a sideways facebook
who keeps saying 90s phrases
when are they going to cancel bart
simpson for saying i carumba
i mean clearly that's cultural
appropriation
hi carumba anyway don't watch event
horizon i don't know why we're here
don't know what we're doing here we've
shucked the format of
of review hey that's kind of fun
sometimes though
go back and revisit something and just
see you know
see what happens see what happens see
what happens i is a movie that i feel is
stuck around and
has a following so it's like yeah it's
like charles manson
it's not a completely forgotten movie so
okay
yeah yeah i mean okay yeah why not
sure why not i mean i the blu-ray looks
nice we're
we're on uh year one of the pandemic why
not
just do whatever started year two of the
pendant we've started year two that's
what i mean yeah
or more years to go okay yeah so
shake things up what better time to
watch event horizon
