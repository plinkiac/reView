And now, the conclusion.
My next episode is, uh, we haven't had any match ups so far.
So I'm, yeah, that's good.
I'm kind of curious, do you have on your list Chain of Command?
I do not.
You do not.
I respect it.
I like it.
But it's not in my re-watchability.
That's fair.
But I think it's, I think it's got some things that are interesting to talk about.
Absolutely.
Which is, which is why I bring it up.
Uh, this is, this is the famous "There are four lights" episode of, of The Next Generation where, uh, Picard is pulled from command of the Enterprise.
He's, he's pulled out of the captain's chair by, uh, Admiral Nechayev because they want Picard to go on a secret mission in Cardassian space.
Starfleet intelligence believes that the Cardassians are developing a metagenic weapon.
Oh, my god.
And they need picard because he's got some knowledge on the subject to go check this out.
So they pull them from command, and then they bring in the villain from Robocop, uh, Commander Jel-, Captain Jellico, to take over the Enterprise.
Presumably permanently.
It's not necessary to give Captain Jellico command of the Enterprise just to conduct a negotiation.
The Enterprise will be in a dangerous situation, and I want someone on the bridge who has a great deal of experience with the Cardassians.
No offense, commander, but that's not you.
and so then uh picard goes on his
mission with crusher and wharf
and it's a trap the kardashians those
evil kardashians
have set a trap to capture picard to
extract
knowledge from him well it's a good
thing they didn't send uh
three nobody starfleet security guards
to go on this mission
so the captain of the flagship you know
what it would be a lamer episode
if it were just a red shirt being
tortured well that's why
you send a 20 year old bajoran girl into
kardashian space on a secret mission
because they don't come back
okay anyway picard is captured
uh picard is tortured and it's
two-parter about
torture I don't enjoy this but I must
demonstrate it will make everything
clearer
i think it's david warner yeah plays the
kardashian
the famous uh british character actor
he's in star trek six the undiscovered
country star trek six he was the villain
in tron
but he he tortures picard and
interrogates him
and basically he can't get any
information out of a card
and at some point he knows that picard
doesn't have any useful information for
him
but he just wants to break picard
for the sake of breaking him I've just
received word
there's been a battle the enterprise is
burning in space
the invasion of minoskova has been
successful he just wants picard to admit
there are
five lights when there aren't they are
there are in fact four
tell me how many lights you see
he wants to dominate him he wants to he
wants to utterly
dominate him and he completely
just completely dehumanizes picard
he like you know his like daughter comes
in the room at some point and like
oh yeah how you doing and didn't even
care that his daughter is witnessing
this this man being horrifically
tortured
because picard doesn't he's just a piece
of meat
but human mothers and fathers don't love
their children as we do
they're not the same as we are the
torturer of
david warner's character from what i
recall is
it's all status for them but on the
inside they're the weakling
they're the scared one I think from what
i recall that happens in the episode the
card breaks him
basically because they they say you've
gone far enough
david warner well he he admits something
that happened when he was a child that
that that that scared him oh no and this
is why he's
like explaining why the the military is
good because before the military took
over kardashian everyone was starving
and things were terrible and I was
i was just a scared little boy and then
picard points out
yeah that's all that's all I'll ever see
when I look at you now you're just a
scared little boy whenever i
look at you now I won't see a powerful
kardashian warrior who see a
six-year-old little boy who is powerless
to protect himself
be quiet lashing out yeah
yeah just infuriates him even more right
right despite all you've done to me i
find you a pitiable man
regard stop it captain takes over and he
is not
laid back at all like things are gonna
be done like this I want four shifts
you gotta get these shifts ready I want
them ready four minutes ago
and we're gonna work extra twice as hard
and everybody on the enterprise is used
to the basically the enterprise like
before then it's just like a
luxury cruise liner everyone's just
hanging out in bar
and doing jazz and and suddenly there's
this harsh
task master in charge but I i think
what's interesting about it to me is
normally and normally in like a star
trek episode when the new authority
figure comes in it's usually
it's usually an admiral but they're
always like
the bad guy they're always evil
and our our heroes have to take charge
back from this commander who's just
they're off their gourd and they're
doing terrible things but the doomsday
machine episode of tos
that's the classic one the admiral's
nuts and he's putting everyone in danger
because he's just gone bonkers
but it's a twist with jellicoe shade of
command
completely subverts that because
everything that captain jelico
does is fucking right
mr wharf prepare to death I will agree
to your terms
excellent this episode makes riker look
like such a fucking asshole
because he he butts heads specifically
with riker
let's drop the ranks for a moment i
don't like you
i think you're insubordinate arrogant
willful
and I don't think you're a particularly
good first officer
and riker just comes off looking like
this petulant brat
well now that the ranks are dropped
captain I don't like you either
you are arrogant and closed-minded
you need to control everything and
everyone but but the truth is that
captain jelico knows exactly how to
handle the kardashians he knows
he knows when to bluff how to bluff we
got him in the nebula we got him right
where we want him we're going to do this
and the sad thing of that episode is
when captain jelico has to come to riker
because riker is the best pilot on the
ship and they need a good
pilot to lay the mines around the nebula
and he basically has to beg riker to do
his fucking job
will you pilot the shuttle commander
yes you're welcome
it's just it's just a very interesting
choice that they didn't make jelica the
villain and I'm wondering why they did
that if they just didn't want to just
shake up what we normally do with the
evil admiral yeah I don't know what the
thinking was behind it yeah
normally it would be like a conventional
more conventional storyline would be
angelico's
gone power mad because he has the
flagship and he's just blowing everybody
up
right oh no angelico's doing is going to
start a war we have to captain
uh commander riker has to find a way to
stop him right really
remove captain jolico from the bridge
I'm taking over
we're leaving this situation and we're
going to rescue picard yeah
but it doesn't work they let picard go
angelico solves the problem
and riker realizes that uh there are
different ways to do things
the salt in the wound is that jelica
angelico even manages to save picard
i understand you're holding a starfleet
officer named jean-luc picard
i expect him returned immediately
even though he doesn't know we gotta we
gotta let the car die but even
even even after that he still manages to
save picard
it is a shame he never came back the
other thing I wonder about this episode
why wasn't this the cliffhanger for
season six
the cliffhanger for season six was
fucking descent
probably one of the worst tng episodes
or stories and this would have been such
a
good uh cliffhanger because it
similar to best of both worlds it it it
leaves the question open as to whether
or not they're going to shake up the
status quo
yeah like maybe they are shaping up
jelico to be the new captain maybe we
won't see picard again
i think they had a cliffhanger problem
six and seven-ish because they also had
picard
gets kidnapped and turned into a
mercenary two-parter
i think that was supposed to be the six
and seven
two-parter and then they said let's do
descent
and let's just put this in as a
two-parter yeah yeah I think
i think there is a lot of uh we don't
have we need we need something that's
really good
what do we got in
right the resonator cannot be stopped by
phases and shields
number four this is an official
uh guilty pleasure episode it is called
disaster oh god that's a very wait no
wait
no that one's fine I i was I thought you
were talking about the episode that was
um die hard on the enterprise
no no no that's a guilty pleasure and a
half
that episode that's okay
i love disaster tapestry was quantum
leap
disaster is more or less the poseidon
adventure
in space yeah
it's patterned after a classic disaster
movie yeah like the 70s
right exactly like poseidon adventure or
towering inferno
or movies like that uh there's personal
drama there's action
ship tech stuff and teamwork conflict
conflict yes um so so the episode starts
off with
picard this is another kind of a famous
picard episode because he's trapped in
an elevator with three children
well then um this one starts off on the
bridge
o'brien's there troy's there um
uh there's a lieutenant lady who's like
the highest rank she's
because like miles o'brien has like no
rank always good to meet another chief
petty officer sergey rajenko formerly of
the uss intrepid
miles edward o'brien good to meet you
he's the transporter technician
yes and so picard leaves the bridge with
three kids who won the science for a
contest and gets in the turbolift
and they run into a quantum filament
some sort of space
anomaly that fucks the ship up royally
um so you have a wonderful little action
scene where everything's like
shaking and exploding and um you have
i think is that four or five different
scenarios of
survival in different parts of the ship
where there's
there's interpersonal drama and conflict
most importantly bridge ten forward
picard and the turbolift and then riker
and data trying to stop the ship from
blowing up
and uh I just I love it it's fun
it's adventurous oh and um uh
uh beverly crusher and jordy laforge
in the cargo bay so so there's all these
great little moments in it
and you know it's not the most
thought-provoking episode it doesn't
deal with
ethics or you know it's just a fun
disaster episode
that that has a lot a lot of nice little
details
yeah um and as I rewatched it
i really enjoyed kind of picking up
on more details uh you start off with
you know troy's on the bridge and and i
wanted to mention
you talked about chain of command after
that she started wearing a proper
uniform
because uh jellico gave her a dressing
down yes
he yelled at her he's like why are you
wearing that
i prefer a certain formality on the
bridge
I'd appreciate it if you wore a standard
uniform when you're on duty
um and put out a fucking uniform and
yeah and eventually troy
takes a test to become
a commander because in this she carries
the rank of lieutenant commander
and she doesn't even know it miles
o'brien mansplains
her own rank to her
i believe counselor troy is the senior
officer on the deck
counselor troy she carries the rank of
lieutenant commander
because she's in command of the
enterprise she's the
ranking officer on the bridge and um so
her situation is
she's in command and she's got the miles
o'brien
the by the numbers by the books guy and
she's got the wild card
ensign row former terrorist who just
wants to let everybody blow up who's
like fucking separate the ship
the the other half the ship's gonna blow
up fuck those people
but that's damned cold-blooded what
about the people down there
there's no evidence that anyone is still
alive in the drive section no
evidence they're dead either she diverts
power from the phasers into the bridge
terminal
like and right o'brien's like what are
you doing that's
dangerous I diverted power from the
phaser array
and I dumped it into the engineering
control system you what
there's this wonderful part because this
is the the the episode where wharf
delivers
keiko o'brien's baby in ten forward and
it's
a humorous light-hearted scene you know
he's like he did the simulation he's
the baby should be coming out now you
know and she's like it doesn't work that
way why
but in the beginning keiko is standing
there and she's like here's my baby
you know and riker's like oh you should
name him william after me
and and data's like can I touch the
belly everybody's interested in the baby
but the way the shot is framed wharf is
standing there with his arms folded like
just looking elsewhere he has
no interest whatsoever he does not give
a shit
and so as fate would have it he's the
one who delivers the baby
in a matter of hours so it's this
wonderful little touch
and then you have and this is probably
me reading in way too much but you have
um
beverly crusher nagging jordy to to be
in her play
he's like I don't sing I don't like
doing this I don't want to do it leave
me alone I'm working and she's like come
on
so like the little touch of everyday
life on the enterprise you know
beverly crusher's always trying to do
plays she's bored
but it turns out geordI's jordy is
hesitant to do an activity
that involves singing which is
lungs I am the very model of a modern
major general I have information
vegetable animal and mineral
i I can't I can't do it yes you can i
cannot sing in front of people
you were terrific breath
breathing capacity oh my god you're
right
you're right that's perfect who's the
first that passes out
when they're gonna run out of oxygen
right yep jordy
who's the one who makes it over the
control panel beverly crusher
who also is a skilled tap dancer
okay she tap dances her way over to the
control panel
and can still maintain breath because
she exercises her lungs in her place
so their character flaws are showed
during that
I'm like oh yeah she made it she made it
over there she's good on her feet
she's the dancing doctor as they say
right that
that that that was a little character
arc for jordy to
maybe try singing a little more he
doesn't have the best lung capacity
uh but their their problem is they have
a plasma fire
and then they have big canisters of
rocket or jet pack fuel
the corona in those containers is used
in emergency thruster packs
it's normally pretty stable stuff but
when you expose piranha to radiation
as a way of exploding that that are just
in the cargo
bay let's just so it's it's neat we like
we don't know what's in those canisters
and so it's like and then picard
picard's like okay you know we got to
get some cabling
uh okay little girl hit hit two buttons
then hit the button below it right
and that'll release the panel like all
those little like tiny technical details
like picard knows all these starfleet
officers know which buttons to hit
that'll make these things happen they've
memorized it all you know what I mean
yeah yeah
and that makes the control panel come on
music pull out all the optical cabling
we're going to use that as a rope
um so the guts of the ship all the
details all those like wonderful things
that you don't see in
discovery everyone's yelling and
exploding things
it's just it's that that kind of stuff
that I like the the personal drama
you can't let wishful thinking guide
your decision counselor
it's time to leave
we will separate the ship when I decide
that it's time and not before
is that clear ensen the action adventure
element of it the survival
how do we survive this situation and and
technical stuff because then riker and
and
data have to get to engineering
and take data's head with them at some
point yes there's a there's an
electrical beam
that they need so they need to break the
circuit on so they need a non-conductive
material and data's like that's my body
you can take off my head and bring it to
engineering you want me to take off your
head
yes sir and we'll figure out what the
problem problem is
so it's like a bunch of wild stuff
happening in this episode
this that's a quality pick I haven't
thought about that episode in a while
but that's a quality pick
yeah characters doing things that are
out of their wheelhouse yeah yeah
troy troy is thrust into
command chair and and you know in her
mind she's just there to be the
counselor
never never thought she'd have to be in
a mate never thought she'd ever have to
make a command decision
uh so she's asking about the quantum
filament and
miles o'brien explains it and she's like
so it's like a cosmic string
and he's like he's like no no that's a
completely different phenomenon
that's an entirely different phenomenon
and then
um and then this is purely for the
audience sake
because riker's not there we've got a
problem
to ask dumb questions but you know
they're talking about having a
containment breach in engineering and
and
troy's like what will happen then
if it falls to 15 the field will
collapse
and we'll have a containment breach
which means
and and uh rose like the ship will
explode
which means the ship will explode
you know that's totally for the sake of
the audience but I think everybody in
starfleet should understand what a
warped core breach
containment breach even those little
kids in the in the elevator shaft
understand what a containment breach
means
um I see that's very
very commendable troy has a problem you
know
she has a decision to make no one's in
engineering
the can the containment field is failing
if it gets down beneath 15 the ship will
blow up is anyone alive down there even
who knows
why don't we separate the ship at least
the people in the saucer section will be
okay
they don't make mention on how the hell
they're gonna get away
i don't think the impulse engines were
working whatever um
uh and then troy's like no you know i
gotta make the call
let's hold out let's see if we can get
some power down there to the
the terminals you know everybody kind of
even though they're all in different
parts of the ship
they'll find a way to work together get
out of their own little situation
it's the poseidon adventure in space and
uh
it's it's just wonderful
i just it's just a rewatchable
rewatchable episode it's quality pick i
haven't I haven't I don't
think to rewatch that one I just haven't
thought about that episode in a while
but no you're reminding me of it
yeah that's a good episode it falls in
line with uh
kind of that um uh one where the
enterprise keeps blowing up over and
over again
speaking of the one where the enterprise
keeps blowing up over and over again
take it away rich my my fourth pick is
cause and effect
which which in my eyes is the the
ultimate space anomaly episode yeah
yeah cause and effect is a a wonderful
uh
time loop episode where in the beginning
of the episode
quite shockingly the first thing that
happens is the fucking enterprise just
blows up and everyone is on the bridge
panicking
i saw that live on tv and I ran
to tell my mom bob the enterprise just
blew up
and she gave two shits
and then we we have the credits and then
after the credits
everything is just normal we I i think
the first thing we see is like the poker
game is that the first thing we see it's
like
the the uh running one of the running
things through tng was that riker
hosts poker games every every week and
they're just
they're just playing poker and they have
some like
vague feelings of deja vu uh
jordy goes to the sick bay he's got a
problem with a was it a headache
or his visor yeah and then um you've
become
the crusher's like have you come in for
this before it's like no I think so
something wrong mr what I am
experiencing nipple
the feeling I've done this before I've
been having the same feeling
wait and then the ship blows up again
and then they're playing poker again
and they're having more deja and this
this loop just keeps continue
continuing where they go through the
same day over and over again
only just every time there's an
increasing feeling of deja vu
to the point where they realize
something is wrong and they don't know
what and it just
i just love the way in this episode they
have to just figure out what's going on
when their memory basically just gets
erased every time they go through it
it's all because kelsey grammer crashed
his ship into this
well that's that's a weird ass aspect of
this episode just kelsey grahamer
comes in out of nowhere on a 100 year
old starship
he was stuck in the loop too yeah and uh
i don't know how he didn't figure it out
after
a hundred plus years but it was it was a
wonderful cameo kelsey grammers
i want to be in the star trek you get
you get that a lot in star trek a lot of
people are trekkies and they just want
to show up in
some form yeah christian slater is in
star trek six the undiscovered company
yeah
mick fleetwood the drummer fleetwood
back
oh yeah yeah where's he on you'll never
even guess
oh my god is he under like some bizarre
alien makeup he's do you remember the
the the fish people that had to be stuck
in those
those tanks of salt that's fleetwood mac
well it's not the whole band yeah it's
just mcfleetwood
iggy pop appears in deep space nine as a
a vorta perhaps one day the ferengi will
take their place
as valued members of the dominion
anything's possible whoopi goldberg that
was basically I'm a fan I want to be in
it it was a bit more than a cameo I mean
they give her a fucking part
but stephen hawking yeah
hologram stephen hawking I don't I don't
have much else special to say about her
other than it just
for a classic it's just a really well
done classic space anomaly episode
yeah I i really like the the visual
effects too
there's some like the visual effects
just got so good
towards the end like like you have like
the naked now
episode uh where they all they all get
the
drunk disease and then wesley crusher
uses the tractor beam to push the
asteroid into the ship so it blows up
wesley crusher and it look it looks so
bad but this like when that
miranda class ship comes out of the the
spatial anomaly
the time anomaly scrapes up against the
warp nay cell and just blows up I mean
it's awesome
it's awesome those models and the
effects later on were awesome
my favorite tng episode
of all time
is the beverly crusher harlequin romance
novel
episode
you perk I'm just you're lying pretty
okay so
this is a deep cut and it and uh
it's my favorite one because we haven't
mentioned one of our favorite characters
lieutenant reginald barkley it's the nth
degree
which berkeley episode was that it is
the one where barkley becomes the
smartest human being who I've
ever existed
lieutenant you could very well be the
most advanced human
being who has ever lived it's all
barkley all the time
and it's it's it's just a wonderful
little character episode
that has that has humor
action
uh an interesting sci-fi premise
no now for for people who don't know
star trek
who is barkley and why is he special
i guess the question is whether mr
barkley is enterprise material
barkley is a man who who lives in the
24th century
and apparently they have not found a
cure for aspergers
um he he is a smart competent starfleet
officer but he's incredibly
socially awkward your preliminary report
had a couple of interesting theories reg
and nervous why don't you bring us all
up to speed on your findings so far
yes
it wasn't a maintenance problem and and
i guess there's no medication for that
either
in the 21st century you can't take an
antidepressant
or some valium or something uh he
he previously had a holodeck addiction
because he hated his normal life so he
escaped to the holodeck
riker you're nothing but a pretty
mannequin in a fancy uniform you're full
of hot air
picard has a problem with me you tell
him to come and talk to me himself
where he like punches riker and he
sleeps with the women on
of the starship enterprise and he
becomes addicted to the holodeck
um but he's he's he's an awkward guy and
nobody likes him
except for jordy kind of tolerates him
it's a wonderful contrast like
everybody else you ever see on star trek
because
every character on star trek is just
confident
and smart and intelligent and
professional
no no sir we'll have to
shut off some systems we'll um
shut them down a few at a time it
shouldn't uh
i don't think so barclays it works for
barkley because he's such a contrast
yeah and and that's why a lot of times
side characters to me even in next-gen
are more interesting uh because you had
that kind of clumsy
sonia gomez character and that you know
she spills the coffee on the card
oh no oh I'm sorry oh captain
um yep gainen um
you know there's characters that are not
there are either our starfleet or aren't
there they're interesting because they
have quirks like riker to me is doll
jordy's a little dull crusher's doll
i think I think riker only exists
because they wanted to back up kirk
yeah if their experiment with the weird
bald diplomat didn't work
we've got kirk 2.0 waiting in the wings
the
the hot shot ladies man who runs around
yeah punches people
yeah no I know that I'm well aware of
that but yeah uh
barkley is is you know off the charts
and it and it starts with
it opens with barkley is in one of dr
crusher's plays
cyrano de bergerac where he is
fumbling his way through his performance
he's terrible he's
he keeps fucking up for getting his
lines and everyone's just like
uncomfortable
ah he does not know ah
not yet but he is proud
noble brave you know and he's he's just
he's
he's a fuck-up he's a royal fuck-up and
then they have to go fix the argus array
is that where you get the um
data why is everybody clapping yes
because it's polite thing
yeah lieutenant barkley's performance
was adequate but
clearly not rooted in the method
approach I do not understand
data because it's polite
because it's polite like wharf and jordy
like side eye each other
oh my god and then the plot starts the
the argus array is this giant space
array that sends communications around
and there's
it's going to blow up basically and they
they don't know they got to try to fix
it
jordy and barkley go out in the shuttle
craft to take a look
and there's a weird space probe there
floating around and it sends a blast of
energy
it doesn't get into jordy's brain
because he has
he's blind and he has his thing but it
gets into barkley's brain
and then he changes little things
little things start building up the the
big first thing is an action scene
the probe is following options number
one
we can't use photon torpedoes an
explosion this close could cripple us
the enterprise uh is being attacked
and chased by the space probe
do you remember this vaguely so it's one
of my favorite shots of the nrp
remember the ending clearly yeah the
enterprise does a full about
and it kind of turns and leaves it's one
of my favorite shots
of of the enterprise d and uh warf's
just like ah
phasers phasers nothing's working we got
to hit it with 10 photon torpedoes but
it's so
close the blast is going to blow us up
too and then basically barkley just says
get out of the way jordy I'm just going
to do this myself I can enhance the
shield by 10 times
their strength you know he basically
saves the ship and jordy's like I don't
know how the hell he did that
and then so you have this great
performance from
dwight schultz uh the a-team guy
yeah where he has to play clumsy awkward
bad actor but then what the devil is he
doing there among us
philosopher scientist poet musician
dualist here lies hercules
he does the scene from uh cyrano
and he moves dr crusher to tears with
his acting
it's not the perfect parallel for the
tng episode
um story wise but it is a nice little
framing device
because in the the cyrano de bergerac
play uh
you know he's an ugly guy with a big
nose and um
he's he's smart and you know thoughtful
on the inside but on the outside he's
ugly
and then there's this other guy
christiane I think who's
kind of more handsome and he's he's
wooing this lady um
but sereno de bergerac's writing the
letters for him and she's impressed by
his
his mind and his thoughts but she
doesn't know it's
the ugly guy writing the letters the the
whole episode reminds me of a story
called flowers for
i think flowers for elderon I think is
the name of the story but basically
they do this uh scientific experiment on
this man who's kind of slow he's not
very intelligent and they
do this experiment and suddenly he's
he's super smart and confident and suave
and good with ladies
it just reminds me of that story yeah
ever since are running with that probe
something's different about you what
because I'm beginning to behave like the
rest of the crew
with confidence in what I'm doing uh so
they say his iq
is like 1400 or some 1200 to 1400
somewhere in that range she's like
you're the smartest human being who's
ever lived
so it's not just raw intelligence we're
talking about here no
creativity resourcefulness inspiration
imagination they've all been enhanced
and yeah so then he saves the argus
array
he figures out a way to fix it quickly
um
he's just blowing past everybody they're
worried about him you know but then
picard's like is there
any danger you know that approach would
require much more time than our original
plan
at least seven weeks I could have it
ready for you in two days
what his brain works so fast
he can't use the computer interfaces so
he has to create
like this this throne room chair and the
holodeck
where he could like interact directly
with the computer
via his brain through lasers through his
brain and he basically becomes the
enterprise he basically becomes the
enterprise computer
so he goes out of control and picard's
like okay
i we can't if we disconnect them from
that he'll dine because
do it I can't have a crazy man
running my ship right um and then
so the the whole premise is that a
highly advanced space alien from the
other side of the galaxy
doesn't go out exploring they bring
people to them
via this technology that makes everyone
so smart they take control the ship
bring it bring it out there it's the
most inefficient way
to study the galaxy I think it's pretty
efficient bring them to you
so it has the seek out new life new
civilizations they have a nice
first contact with this alien uh and
then he gets brought back to his normal
self
after after the uh the whole adventure
is over
how do you feel now smaller
just plain old barkley huh and then at
the very end there's a little
little cute sitcom ending where he walks
past the chessboard you know
oh and he moves a chess piece and he's
like checkmate nate moves
i think it's troy who says I didn't know
you played chess and he's like I don't
know that's that's almost a guilty
pleasure the episode is not
like the best episode of star trek the
next generation
i mean it is on my list that's your
favorite it's one of my favorites
it's hard to pick a favorite it's i
would say it's it could be tied with a
couple others I'm not sure but
really I really love it because it it
checks all these boxes to me
i love the leisure time on the
enterprise where they they they
socialize and they have plays and
poetry readings and and then you know
you got that ending where wharf
and the security guards are trying to
blow them up with phasers and
it's just ridiculous it's ridiculously
fun science a science fiction episode
and has a great performance by dwight
schultz where he goes
he transforms into another another
character
i would be sad if none of our top fives
had a berkeley episode so I'm glad you
picked that one
and a lot of your top fives are mine too
like you said it's very hard to pick the
top five very hard
you must trust me
okay so so similar to you I think my my
favorite all-time episode of star trek
is is not one of your obvious choices
like
your inner lights or your chain of
command best of both worlds
my favorite episode of star trek is
probably most people think is
pretty standard episode but considering
i like standard star trek that's
probably not too shocking
it is who watches the watchers
which is uh an episode where um
there is this outpost on a planet that
is studying uh
these proto-vulcans they're they're this
alien race they're they're still
pretty primitive they're like bronze age
stone age not
a little over stone age but they're not
very advanced they don't know anything
about space travel
and some federation anthropologists are
are studying them they've got this this
holographic
projector that's covering up this little
watchtower base they've got in this
little
rock rocky hill area but but it's
malfunctioning it it needs this
you know engineering assistance from the
enterprise to get the hollow projectors
back on
or else locals will see it uh the
enterprise
doesn't get there in time we're on our
way
in fact there's an explosion and um
some of the locals on this printed
planet they see this
strange phenomena going going on what's
what's that because
you know they don't know shit about
holographic projectors they know bows
and arrows
and whatnot and so they go over to
investigate it
and they see what to them is is magic
they see captain picard with his
this alien with a starfleet uniform on
you know directing things and
they're using this fantastic technology
to beam people away
and basically this cultural
contamination
and now this this this race now starts
to believe in picard as a literal god
noria I'm not saying that all the old
beliefs are true
but I did see the picard and I was
restored
back to life it just it's a it's a good
ethical dilemma episode
and it's also a good um prime directive
episode I was gonna say that we haven't
had a prime directive episode
but each of us including dr palmer took
an oath that we would uphold the prime
directive
if necessary with our lives this is
this is my the best prime directive
episode in my opinion um the prime
directive if you don't know anything
about star trek is
basically they have starfleet has a no
interference policy with
if you're if you're an alien race and
you you haven't gotten out into space
yet
it is forbidden to to visit that planet
and this episode is basically why that
policy is in place
not just to visit the planet because you
could do that in secret to to observe
but to
interfere interfere with the natural
progression
of the society uh or the planet
because I think they're uh
there was the the pen pals episode where
they were
debating whether or not to rescue the
little girl
and her family yeah what do we do today
may
profoundly affect the future and to
stop the volcanoes from going off
because they're like
okay well all these volcanoes are going
to kill everyone on the planet really
is it really interference if they're all
going to die if we do nothing yeah
that's yeah
that's the way it's got to go what are
you proposing
if we can determine the cause of these
geological disturbances
we might be able to reverse the process
violate the prime directive but yeah
where it's like a civilization is
is so primitive and there's some kind of
disease or you can't just go down and
cure the disease and leave she's going
to die they're all going to die
unless yes unless because that's the
natural progression of their society
their
you know their culture might have died
out it could create warp drive at some
point that's really the
i think that's the big the big thing is
once you create warp drive that's when
yeah that's when you're you're going to
run into other species anyway
you're officially on the map finally
time to just
show up and give everybody a briefing
which is another one of my favorite
episodes didn't quite make the list
first contact the the other first
contact
yes riker is is found out as a secret
alien
yeah your arrival will change our entire
understanding of life and some will not
want it to change
also a slight nod to a kind of a funner
episode
when data data crash lands
and gets covered in in radiation and he
just
wanders into a primitive town and goes
and he forgets who the fuck he is and he
starts telling them things
he gives everybody radiation poisoning
yes yes
that's a good start I love when he
interferes with the ladies class she's
like everything comes from the three
elements
fire wood and water
i do not believe that is correct oh
i believe you were reasoning by analogy
classifying objects and phenomena
according to superficial observation
rather than empirical evidence
actually everything you're teaching them
is wrong yeah he's irradiating the whole
town and they're like oh boy they show
up
accidental prime directive yeah mishaps
are a lot of a lot of fun episodes
and this is certainly a classic one this
is a classic one um
also uh it's fun just seeing the like
races uh meet starfleet for the first
time like like
you get to see aliens from the aliens
perspective in a way
like you know yeah because we are the
aliens visiting them yeah
and that's that's always that's that's
fun when that happens on these shows
something something else I like about
this episode is it's refreshing to me
that star trek has put
star trek puts no value in the concept
of faith
star trek is all about reason and and
and rationality
triumphing and like like this episode
illustrates that because uh the
thing in this episode is like oh my god
we've given these people a belief system
we have to fix this grievous error at
any cost
we have a problem the contamination
it's worse than we suspected the mentals
are beginning to believe in a god
and the one they've chosen is you
and that's fun to me they don't just you
mean they don't just leave
yeah they don't just leave it's like
well they believe in something now
and you mean they just don't skip
skip town like like luke skywalker and
han solo did
forever altering the ewok culture
as they thousands of years later there
are statues
of c-3po on a cross
but picard is willing to give his own
life to stop these people from believing
in something
yeah yeah he gets shot with an arrow
yeah
but if the only proof you will believe
is my death
then shoot lego don't do it
he proves to them that he is human do
they wipe their memories at the end i
don't remember no that's pen pals
yeah this one they they reference pen
pals they try to
wipe the memory of the guy who saw
picard yeah and it just doesn't work
oh brains too different eventually so
eventually
what happens is picard takes the like
the I know she's a tribal leader but one
of their
one of the higher ups in their culture
up to the starship
and he just wants to explain to her he's
trying to explain to this person what
what like technology is like no this
none of this is magic because they they
keep
they keep wanting like card like can you
bring back our dead
yeah yeah yeah yeah so he eventually
takes her to the sick bay where one of
the
anthropologists dies from the wounds
when the the base
exploded oh yeah yeah I can't bring back
that's right that's right it's been a
while since I've seen this one
he has a he has a good little speech
where he's like now in your past people
used to live in caves right well yes
they live in houses now and this is
things progress
it's not a mind-blowing episode it's not
an epic episode
it's a it's a standard
star trek tng episode and that and that
that golden era of like
seasons threes through five or like
almost
every episode was perfect yeah and it
just it just
it represents all of that to me it's a
it's an encapsulating episode
yeah it's a figurehead episode prime
directive
ethics aliens
magic non non-violent problem solving
that's uh yeah I like who watches
the watchers as well
they they they redo that uh that secret
um uh insurrection
insurrection the secretly hidden
observation
window in insurrection but yeah there's
there's a there's a handful of uh
episodes like that where they uh
infiltrate
an emerging alien culture yeah to to
study them
and then they get caught then there's a
couple of reverses where
alien advanced alien cultures infiltrate
them it's
it's basically it's the opposite of what
kirk would have done in the original
series I remember an episode of star
trek the original series
where they they're dealing with a
primitive culture that doesn't have
space travel
and kirk like starts reading them the
constitution of the united states
we the people this document says we the
people
you can get away with that shit back
then yeah 1960s sure
picard is a was a better diplomat than
uh than captain kirk yeah I think that's
fair
who's the cowboy picard was the diplomat
that's a lot of tng talk rich oh god
yeah
we had you know what the shocking thing
is we didn't have one overlap
i know that's weird weird that's weird
we both like our you you didn't really
have any too many guilty pleasures not
really
no it's not that I there's probably it's
not like I don't like these episodes
like
like I i this list might even change if
i had
the time to sort through and re-watch
every episode properly
sure I would consider cause and effect
kind of a guilty pleasure episode it's
not really like
like a big thinker but it's fun yeah
it's neat
but yeah you got you you got to have
your prime directive you got to have
your
card speech episodes you got to have
your
your lighthearted episode you know where
uh
uh neither of us apparently like the
klingon crap
uh no those are like the wharf episodes
i don't want to say I hate the klingon
politics episodes but
I'm never I'm never delighted when that
like when I turned on the tv
back before I could just watch whatever
episode I wanted and it was a wharf
episode it was like
okay yeah and neither of us seem too
keen on
very specific data episodes either other
than a measure of a man but
data's an interesting character he's
also kind of creepy
i would not participate in a murder.
Remember, in Dissent, Data got emotions and he decided he was going to kill all of his friends.
He's a little creepy.
Then he put that emotions trip back in in Star Trek Generations and went fucking nuts.
To be fair, though, what, what came damn close to being on my list was, uh, was it The Most Toys?
Yes.
That's a great episode.
Which, I guess, bonus episode.
It's a, it's similar in vain to Measure of a Man.
Is Data property or--
Yeah.
--a creature.
But that guy didn't give a shit.
Maybe, maybe we'll talk about that next time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There are our top five episodes.
We could easily make a top ten.
We could, uh, continue this ride.
I think ten--
Ten's a bit much.
Yeah.
Ten, ten's a bit much for one show.
Doing another, uh, five I'd be down.
Five total, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just pick five more that you really like that are in your top ten.
We can talk about them someday soon.
After coronavirus is over.
If it's ever over, Mike.
But we always have our Star Trek, uh, on Blu-ray.
And we'll always have our Star Trek phaser props to play with.
Ah!
Till next time on re:View.
It is over.
