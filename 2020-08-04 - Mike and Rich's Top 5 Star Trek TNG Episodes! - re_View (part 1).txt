Hello, everyone.
And welcome to another episode of Two Old Men and Paper.
I'm your host, Mike. 
And I am Rich Evans.
And, uh, today we have met on the re:View set to discuss our favorite show of all time.
But I can't speak for you.
But it's Star Trek: The Next Generation
And we've decided to select our top five favorite episodes.
we've often called back to star trek
right
other than my reviews of the tng feature
films
we've called back to star trek moments
here this reminds me of this
but we never delved into it we very
rarely talk about the star trek we
actually like which is why when you came
up to me a few weeks ago and said
why don't we do a top picks for tng I'm
like yeah
why not only problem was
i went to make my top five episodes of
tnt and i
couldn't fucking do it all right that
should do it
you ready yes because
there are too many great episodes of tng
but let's let's get on with our
tng top picks top picks at tng
um we do not know each other's picks no
and I've selected mine based on several
things
rewatch ability um a little guilty
pleasure
you could take episodes like measure of
the man
the inner light uh drum head
episodes that have like a really strong
um like moral message
and then they're really quality written
chain of command part one and two
um but then there's really fun indulgent
episodes and so I picked them
based on the ones that I like to
re-watch
yeah because star trek tng I like
watched that that was back in the day
before there was an internet
so like there was an episode on it was a
rerun
and it was an episode I was glad to see
that was that's a big thing like oh it's
that episode I like that episode
well I think we both would agree without
looking at each other's lists that best
of both worlds one and two
are on it no no no okay
the best of the it's fine episode it it
doesn't even make my top 10.
okay okay is it on is it on your list
it's on my list i
assumed I want to talk about it i
definitely want to talk about I have
things to say about it it doesn't make
my best of list though
okay okay um I just assumed it would so
i did it on mine
okay um it is one that I rewatch and it
is one that I like it's very pivotal
here's what here's what I have to say
about the best of both worlds
it is not my favorite episode of star
trek
but it might be the most important
episode of star trek
for reasons I will get into when you
talk about it well let's talk about it
right now number five
the best of both worlds this is the big
borg episode it's the famous thing that
everybody goes to
uh you know that's what the star trek
picard tv show dealt with
sort of the borg picard becomes the
cutest it's a two-parter it ends season
three
and begins season four considered the
apex
of the two seven seasons of tng a little
rough in the beginning
gets great and then a little rough at
the end
it's it's it's peak ripeness of star
trek and that two-parter
halfway through that was edge of your
seat stuff when you saw it live on tv
oh my god ryker's gonna blow up picard
now I'm I'm curious were you watching
this like did you see that
like during season three at the end did
you like did you have to wait for the
cliffhanger to resolve
actually no I was watching
old star trek right uh-huh i
i was I was uh my dad always had old
star trek on and I used to watch it with
him and then I started getting into the
movies
and this was probably around maybe
season five of star trek the next
generation yeah
and I was watching a marathon and I was
like
blown away by the end and all I had to
do was wait
maybe 20 minutes for the continuation
yeah and I was I was like hooked at that
point
i remember when it started and
it was like 87 you know I was pretty
young so I was like you know who's that
bald guy
where's captain kirk and I went outside
and
playing basketball outside similar to
you I was like 10 years old when tng
started
and I was a dumb kid so when I heard
about star trek the next generation my
my first reaction was
you can't do star trek without kirk and
spock
security this is the captain
security what the fuck are they doing
this is gonna suck and so I i had a just
so dumb ten-year-old me built in
negative feelings towards dng
you were the first like internet
naysayers yeah I was first into nice
hair before there was internet and then
i
probably saw like one season one episode
and it was probably some crap like a
code of honor and I was like yeah I was
right
this show sucks I see
code of honor the racist episode that's
the racist episode when tasha yar tries
to
hit a black lady with a spiked ball with
the poison
yeah and they're on a jungle gym yeah
yeah it was terrible oh yes
and I i I turned my back on tng I'm like
yeah I was right
i never watched it again meanwhile it's
kind of ironic though
not to cut you off because a lot of the
season one episodes were carry over
writers from the old
old show and they all felt kind of horny
and dated
that's a different that's a different
conversation why why the kind of shit
they did on tos
just did not work on tng I don't know
why I don't have time to analyze that
shit right now
that's too much to think it's too much
to get into I could picture kirk
with a thing and a spike ball
what's the problem I didn't have that
music yeah okay
but so I'm not watching star trek
anymore I'm not watching it and
meanwhile
like season two of tng is like rocky but
it gets really
there's like some big peaks in season
two some great episodes I'm missing all
of that season three starts
some of the best fucking star trek ever
made I am completely ignoring it
and then the best of both worlds happen
and
it was like a pre-internet meme you know
resistance is futile and that that image
of picard with the laser eye
staring at that that that just
spread throughout the culture I i heard
about that I'm like what's this
fucked up shit that's going on with star
trek like there's a this borg these
horrible these horrible monsters that
suck away your individuality and do body
horror and
they got picard I got I'm gonna tune in
to star trek again
and when I tuned in because this wasn't
the internet you couldn't watch any
episode you ever wanted
i just saw like a random season three
episode
and that's what got me hooked on tng but
i didn't I didn't start watching tng
again
until the fucking meme of resistance's
feudal borg
just started spreading through schools
or wherever I heard about it
well best of both worlds is like like a
big
it's a good it's like the best star trek
movie it's a thriller
acknowledged fire anti-matter spread
it's a thriller um it's set up of course
with uh
cue who the earlier episode where
the borg are just a stand-alone thing
they're a device we don't even know if
they're real maybe q invented them
um to to take humanity down a peg like
picard's like well we're ready for any
challenge out there in space we're
humans
he's like oh be careful
through a resolute we're determined
and your help is not required
we'll just have to see how ready you are
and then they run into the borg just
this unstoppable
of mindless drones that are just gonna
steal your individuality
you can't fight them with weapons you
can't you can't negotiate with them
they're just unstoppable their
technology is too far beyond
anything starfleet has their biggest
advantage their technology is
completely fucking useless against the
board right
their technology and their their
individuality their negotiation their
humanity their
all of all of the federation's strengths
are weaknesses against the borg
uh q saves them at the end but then
there's this like looming threat that
they return and that's how best
of both worlds starts it's got it starts
off with
a spooky music captain's logs stardate
439
89.1 the enterprise has arrived at jury
four
in response to a distress signal from
one of the federation's outermost
colonies
and it's just this ominous beginning and
the admiral's there and he
he brings in shelby and you know and
then the story begins
the borg have entered the outskirts of
federation space
by the way I don't I don't know if it
was their original intention when they
wrote that episode and they just kind of
grafted the borg story onto it
that was actually hinted at as early as
i think season one
two federation outposts in sector 3-0
have been destroyed
romulans that's the assumption
they think it's the romulans who are
ripping colonies out of the ground
we are here because our outposts which
border on the neutral zone
were also attacked destroyed in the
exact same manner as your own
it's this mystery back back even in like
the end of season one I think
maybe they were just planning to set up
for a big villain and then they just
decided this is it
I've always thought that the borg like
the kyuhu
episode was like so like oh this new new
enemy's cool let's bring them back
you wanted to frighten us we're
frightened
the the plot is is fairly simple
but the the undertones of the plot
are what's the most interesting part as
we've discussed this
before in our private life off camera
best of both worlds does not refer to
the federation flagship and the borg
it's really a story about commander
riker it's a riker episode
uh it's all about
ambition commander data I realize your
very nature
omits ambition nevertheless I want you
to know I seriously considered you as
first officer
thank you sir and that's the neat thing
about it
is the borg are a giant
cube metaphor for ambition
and and all they want is to
move up consume become stronger
and riker is at that point in his life
where he's been offered many captaincies
well when he was introduced on the show
that was like his big drive I'm gonna be
the big captain I gave up my
relationship with
with troy the love of my life because
I'm so ambitious it's gonna hold me back
i need to take
the higher positions in starfleet
goodbye troy I'm on the fast track
yeah so you have the borg you have
picardus is settled in his role as
captain and riker has
in the episode he gets offered a command
you're ready to work without a net
you're ready to take command
and you know enterprise will go along
just fine without you
and he turns it down so he talks to troy
and and ten forward and it's like you
know what am I doing you know I'm like
treading water here and she's he
you know the question is brought up
whether or not he's scared of the big
chair
he wants to stay in the enterprise but
he also wants
to be captain and so that's the big
dilemma
the the picard gets kidnapped and that's
the end
of this the first half the first episode
is
riker has the chance to blow up picard
well
he hit that point he has the best of
both worlds he's
he's on the enterprise he's with his
friends he's got troy and he's the
fucking captain of the enterprise
he's got it all yep the best of both
worlds means he has the ship he wants
and the position he wants
um and so you also have it's reflected
in other characters too you have the
the super old admiral who dies
and then you have a young woman named
commander shelby
who is an ambitious go-getter and so
that
theme is woven into her character too i
have been
reluctantly forced to conclude that
commander shelby
our expert on the borg has an ideal
choice at this time for first officer
everyone gets what they want except for
card
this is before um you had like plot
leagues
like seasons in advance and you didn't
know what was going to happen or the
next season of the show
you got to that cliffhanger at the end
of the best of both worlds for all you
knew
the future of star trek tng was going to
have riker as the captain
you didn't know if that was going to be
the new status quo or not that's true
that's why it was such a powerful uh
ending great cliffhanger
they couldn't they could never recreate
that cliffhanger
so many times they've tried you do it
now and they'd say well they're not
getting rid of patrick stewart he's
under contract for
a few more seasons you find that out on
twitter
well yeah so then you know you have a
big you have a big federation crisis
which which we haven't really seen
before so then we get the battle of wolf
three five nine the enterprise is late
to battle level three five nine which is
good for them
because they would have gotten blown up
and it's good for the show's budget
because we don't get to see it
yes um we see the remnants we see all
the floating carcasses of the ships
spark sparking in this this like
graveyard of
death as the borg have just plowed
through them
yeah and then we actually see the real
battle of wolf 359 in the
the pilot episode of star trek deep
space nine we never saw the actual
battle
in uh star trek the next generation we
just see the aftermath of it
but deep space nine was just on the cusp
of
of not using models anymore so so that
battle
in comparison to something like star
trek discovery
a little tame but I'm very happy
I'm very happy with tame in hindsight
I'll take tame
over this nightmare any day
so riker has a talk with with gainan who
i love
i love gainan on tng I wish she showed
up more yeah she's a
far better counselor than troy ever was
i don't hate troy but but man
gainen was really great at just dealing
with people's issues
troy troy seems like she's reading out
of like a counselor's script
you know what I mean recovery from a
great
loss involves a great deal of pain
if we try to avoid that pain we can make
it harder on ourselves in the long run
where she's just like saying like like
platitudes and like
rehearse stuff that a counselor should
say but the ironic procedure 1a
in the handbook says that the problem is
this yeah
would counselor troy not be a more
appropriate choice to speak with keiko
she already has didn't help but the the
the ironic part is is that she's an
empath
no you're wrong I feel better today than
i have in ages
you're absolutely wrong deanna guyana is
not
although she very well could be she's
very mysterious but she
she's very wise she's lived for 800
years or something so
she's seen a lot she's she's got her
mysterious backstory with picard
that's one of the hugest letdowns of the
show but
whatever now they're gonna dig her up
for uh
star trek picard season two and she's
gonna run around with a machine gun
she's gonna bring out that famous gun
that she she has hidden behind the bar
that she used to break up the bar fight
remember that
it shot out like like sparklers god i
don't remember that I wish I did
yeah and then guyan takes out this giant
gun from behind
the bar and shoots it into the ceiling
with no regard for safety of the people
in the deck above
so yeah best of both worlds
action-packed
the bunch of encounters with the borg
some fights they got to go rescue picard
uh they they use uh their knowledge is
he's still linked to collective and you
know some action stuff
um but really episode about riker I've
always thought the ending of best of
both worlds just kind of a letdown
i put them all to sleep
to sleep
there's one thing that would have made
it perfect
the episode ends with picard in his
ready room and he's got
a couple of bandages on his head you
know crusher took out all the
implants and then it he he looks
longingly out his
window to his ready room and the camera
pans back
he's looking at earth too right he's
looking at earth they're in orbit of
earth and so he's just sort of like
contemplative and he's looking out the
window and it ends with just kind of a
sad
you know just the credits start rolling
picard should have just been back at the
desk
hitting the pad captain or something
something something we're in space doc
where repairs are going to take so
fine fine fine fine thank you thank you
cut then it cuts to 10 forward and
riker's having a drink all by himself
and the camera pulls back
you know one of those lonely forward
endings yeah
where he's looking out the window with
contemplation
oh because he's back where he started
yeah I think at that point though they
knew
what got audiences excited was the hype
about the borg and picard getting
assimilated
it stopped being a riker episode like
i I think I think that story would have
worked a lot better for me if
riker actually did become a captain
shortly after that like that's like
that's the end of the arc for him after
that story right yeah he has to decide
to move on
yeah and he he never does because it's a
serialized tv show and
he's one of your main characters right
but if there was some reflection on that
on and from his character and if that
would have cropped up more throughout
the rest of the show
after best of both worlds riker is guy
who asks
questions about what's going on that's
his job
except it's missing several of the key
roxic sequences
it's been a long time since I took
genetics doctor the warp field generator
is a power flow anti-attenuator and that
of course
naturally created an amplification of
the inherent energy output
huh I see that you have to compensate
for the gravimetric interference before
is there something wrong sir
no
i don't know he is he is the guy whose
career
stalled just like like the admiral and
other people were predicting
was gonna happen to riker if he didn't
make a fucking move soon
that's exactly what happened to him yeah
yeah
he was happy where he was but uh he he
he was the first officer and and if the
script needed
somebody to ask a layman question they
always went to riker
yeah it also might mean they're
shapeshifters of some kind
so they could have appeared on earth as
humans you mean if I go back only one of
us could return
that's right you mean we could have come
into this room sat at this table and had
this conversation a dozen times already
a dyson sphere
it's a very old theory number one I'm
not surprised that you haven't heard of
it
but anyway that's the best of both
worlds are
well I guess it's my number five yeah
mr wharf fire
okay so we're gonna go on rich you're
going to say your next episode
um but I wrote up some things while i
was picking out my episodes
and I i was just fascinated by the
variety of stories
that that occur in in star trek the next
generation and if you could think of any
extra ones
okay you tell me um so I have we have
episodes that are about space anomalies
problems with a space anomaly
interpersonal relationships
love stories etc space politics
inter-species conflicts etc prime
directive
you know first contact that stuff uh
light-hearted episodes about daily life
aboard the ship
scary nightmarish episodes alien
abductions
threats mysterious illnesses uh
morality lesson episodes of course i
would
i would say specifically ethical dilemma
sure ethical dilemma wharf wants to kill
himself
uh troy's mother is in love with the guy
who has to do a ritual suicide at age
60. um things like that that's an
ethical dilemma
and inter-species ethical dilemmas guest
spot
characters who bring a mystery or
problem to the enterprise
the the fake time traveler from the
future who's really from the past
shit like that the guy who steals data
the most toys
uh wacky situations that characters find
themselves in
i have the menage menage troye episode
where they're kidnapped
uh there's some that are a little more
like um where they're more dangerous
you know picard's uh picard's vacation
captain's holiday
when he's in the wacky situation with
vash and the ferengi is trying to find
the
the treasure um I consider that a wacky
situation
a character finds themselves in
to understand someone that is different
from you
you have the the episode where jordy had
to team up with romulan when when like
one of them was blind and the other one
could walk on the the electrical stump
that's the london core episode I was
going to say that's a more dangerous
situation sure are y'all are dharmak and
gelato dharmak and jalad uh
dharmak episode yes um where you're
trapped with someone you've got to
understand them it's
similar to the gorn episode
dangerous or survival situations
characters find themselves in
there's just straight up like we've got
to survive picard and beverly are fall
in that hole
and that guy's selling the automated uh
laser
things that are trying to kill people
remember the planet that sells like
like war weapons that's defunct and
they're like stuck in this trap where
these things are flying around trying to
murder them
or the episode final mission picard
wesley and that guy
are trapped on the desert planet and
there's this waterfall and they're
thirsty but it's covered with the
foreshield
you know there's some little character
stuff going on there
um straight up mysteries or whodunits
do you remember when data wouldn't tell
anybody uh what's going on and
i think it was called clues yeah um and
uh picard was like what's going on data
you're lying to us you know and who's
trying to save them
because this alien said if they come
back he's going to blow him up so data
had to lie and cover it up
mystery so it's also I'd say it probably
fits in close with space now but also
cause an effect
cause and effect uh which can fall under
space anomalies
so that that's just a list and then i
have a list of
of types of episodes from star trek
discovery
number one violence
i don't I don't have any so going
through all the star trek episodes I i
had to pick from
all these wonderful variety of kinds of
stories
and I'm sure there's even more and
there's different there's there you
could blend these two together
and uh we'll we'll talk a little bit
more on that rich go
next episode okay I got a measure of a
man and i
i I was reluctant to even bring this one
up
because star trek picard shit all
over it I still I still have to bring it
up
it's an important episode it's a famous
episode
basically there is this the scientist
maddox from the daystrom institute
and um data is very special android and
his creator is dead nobody
nobody can figure out how to make data
they can't figure out how to recreate
this technology so this guy from the
daystream institute
he wants to take apart data's brain well
technically
a data's creator's not dead yet we don't
know that everyone thinks he's dead
you're getting I had to jump that in
there you know why
i know why but it would just confuse the
discussion of this particular episode
because for all practical intents and
purposes
everyone thinks that he is dead correct
so he he decides you know
we this is important technology we need
this I need to take commander data's
brain apart
i thought that we could talk this out
that I could try to
persuade you your memories and knowledge
will remain intact
and data because he has free will
he he doesn't want this done to him
but maddox being the villain of this
episode is like no you're
you're a machine you are property and i
am going to demand that you come with me
because you are starfleet property
you're going to come with me I'm going
to take apart your brain
and picard is like commander data is a
valued member of my bridge crew
based on what I've heard I can't allow
commander data to submit himself to this
experiment
fuck that shit and so they're they're on
the starbase
and they're going to have a little trial
because the the local local judge is in
town who has a
backstory of a card but no way to go
anywhere it doesn't go anywhere and
nobody fucking cares and so we're gonna
we're gonna have this
this legal battle to determine the fate
of data yeah I guess they need a
prosecuting attorney and the only
qualified person is riker
and the unenviable task of prosecuting
this case would fall on you commander as
the next most senior officer of the
defendant's ship
i can't I won't and so riker
is forced against his will to testify
against data she adds a little
interpersonal drama
yeah yeah and it's just a I i I think
it's just
this episode's a good example of just
the the the ethics of
of star trek the the federation's
willingness to just
accept things that are different from
them like no data's person he's got
rights and we're gonna
we're gonna fight for his rights uh yeah
and
where where this this new
ethical challenge has not come up yet
and now here it is it's like pen pals
yeah you know yeah my emotions are
involved
data's friend is going to die that means
something
to data uh which is another good example
of
uh that kind of episode and that that
definitely belongs
in in a top five episode
list it is also probably the the
ultimate example of the picard speech
because the entire ending of this
episode is just
one epic picard speech that saves the
day
your honor a courtroom is a crucible in
it we burn away irrelevances until we're
left with a pure product
the truth for all time this is one of
the best examples of that it's also a
good guiding episode because he gets the
he gets the advice he needs from gainan
right right beforehand he's
he's he's at his cards at his lowest
point like picard
riker did a really good demonstration
that date is just
he's a machine you can take his arm off
press the button he turns off and yeah
card's like oh no what what can I do and
then guyana he goes 10 forward
goes to the bar talks to guyana and she
she points out no no it's not about
whether or not he's a machine this is a
slavery issue
he's talking about slavery
i think that's a little harsh I don't
think that's a little harsh I think
that's the truth
and picard's like owned it inspires him
to make
the ultimate picard speech he saves the
day with his words
perfectly well written episode yeah
perfect
it's a shame that star trek picard shit
all over it that eventually androids
became slaves
and picard didn't seem to give two fucks
i fucking hate that so much
that show I'm so glad coronavirus
happened
oh yeah hell yeah
my next episode will also be a similar
kind of ethical
dilemma kind of episode uh probably not
a fan favorite episode but it's one that
i
i like a lot in the regard of measure of
a man it's called the drum head
are you familiar with this oh yeah yeah
i haven't seen it in a while so you
might need to remind me of stuff but
yeah
um it's not a fun re-watch
but it's a good episode that ends with a
great picard speech the the premise
is they they foolishly
allow a klingon scientist
aboard the enterprise who uh
the best klingon scientist was in that
beverly crusher episode
yeah where she was just like obviously
just abused by her own culture that
klingons obviously do not respect
scientists and so she is extremely
insecure about
everything yeah
i have heard enough of your accusations
now I will have your silence
uh but this guy does not look like a
scientist
he's really angry and he gets accused
uh rightfully so of stealing secrets
you accuse me because I am klingon
because he
he claims to have a disease that he has
to take daily injections for and then
they discover he's used a device
and encoded in the uh injection serum
like
i don't know micro rna sequences that
compute to computer information so he's
literally carrying secrets out in his
bloodstream
so they they catch them but but the the
trigger point for the episode
is uh the warp engine explodes
not not destroying the ship but a part
of it blows up
leaks radiation out into the warp engine
area and they have to close the door
and vent the radiation so it's this big
like it's a conspiracy
who sabotaged the warped core right
obviously somebody sabotaged the warp
somebody sabotaged the warped core and
stole secrets so then you have this
this admiral her name is admiral satie
they established counselor troy in the
very beginning and she's
determining whether or not the klingon
is lying she says it's hard he's hard to
read
it's hard to tell he's very closed
captioning not
idea what happened to available troy or
why picard didn't ask her
you know can you help out here it's a
drum head trial
which picard explains is like an old
like
uh military uh tribunal uh what do they
called court martial
but but not an official one where they
they you sit on a drum and they just
like
they like say you're guilty you know
uh so like like an unfair trial is a
drum head trial
and um like kangaroo court kangaroo
court right
uh admiral saty comes in there and she's
got we discover later she's gotta hang
up
she's a little nuts she's trying to live
in the shadow of her father who is a
great judge
what you're doing here it's unethical
it's immoral I'll fight it
do what you must captain
and so will I they begin this
prosecution she's got a betazoid with
her
and this other lady who just takes notes
and looks like smug
and they come investigating and so um
it's just you know without just going
through the entire plot
it starts to spiral out of control
because I have access does not
would you say if I told you there is
evidence that the explosion in the
engine room was caused by a corrosive
chemical
one that is kept stored in sickbay
i had nothing to do with that they they
accused this
they find this this guy who has
like kind of vulcanish romulan ears his
name is
something tarsus lieutenant ensign
tarsus
and they're they're like did you chat
with this klingon
you know and he's like a little bit i
guess and then they're like he's hiding
something he's hiding a dirty secret
and it turns out he lied on his
application to starfleet his
great grandfather or grandfather was
romulan and not vulcan which makes him
ineligible
you know and they ruin his career and
then they're like okay
stop stop stop and then and then jordy
and data say oh it's an accident
i believe sir that the conclusion to our
investigation must be
that the explosion was not intentional
that's the way I see it
this wasn't sabotage at all it was
nothing more than
an accident there was a flaw in the in
the casing
on the warp core and it blew up and
she's like there wasn't an accident I'm
going to keep digging
they ally themselves with wharf because
wharf
is crazy it said his klingon blood man
he just becomes a true believer in
prosecuting everybody
oh yeah for everything they they
instantly recognize wharf
as an ally he can be your your ss
officer
and he does recruit like
a team of security people that all start
doing digging
he's just like immediately down with it
wharf wharf is not the best starfleet
officer
i do not understand I mentioned
something new not in that episode do you
remember conundrum
when which one was that which one's it's
they they uh
they get all their minds erased their
memories erased
and nobody knows rank the computer's
offline it's so this
these aliens can take over the ship and
blow up their enemies
wharf thinks he's the captain because
he's got the sash he's like I must be
the captain and he's like
i think we should kill everyone
the faces are operational we now have
full tactical control
you know and picard's like but mr wharf
captain wharf
maybe we should look into this a little
more
i disagree full phasers target them and
destroy them you know it's kind of funny
wharf is he has violent tendencies and
he doesn't think very clearly
if there is a conspiracy on board i
promise you
i will find it they they they recruit
them to their cause
it starts getting out of control and
eventually like
they're pointing at everyone you're a
conspirator you're a conspirator
and um then picard is put up on the
stage
just last year you had a vulcan
ambassador on board who turned out to be
a romulan
what did you do about it in fact she was
not a vulcan at all was she
she was a romulan spy
that's correct did you try to steal her
back from the romulans because she had
federation secrets
and they the the the head of starfleet
security comes to the trial
and first it was a closed session now
it's like open to the public everyone's
there and it becomes like like a witch
trial
yeah um picard makes a great speech and
then
the admiral melts down in front of
everybody and the
the head of surface security just leaves
without saying a single word
and um he's just like like that's how
and it's kind of reflective in today's
society you know that's how things can
just spin out of control you think we've
come so far torture of
heretics burning of witches all ancient
history
then before you can blink an eye
suddenly it threatens to start all over
again
uh so it's a good like episode about
that kind of um
kind of fear that could happen slippery
slope
um mccarthyism uh that sort of stuff
but she or someone like her will always
be with us waiting for the right
climate in which to flourish spreading
fear
in the name of righteousness another
great example of a picard speech
yes yes picard just is this who we've
become
you know you put you're fucking putting
me on trial now the first was a
was a dirty klingon who was literally
stealing secrets
but it was a coincidence it was
unrelated to the explosion
but there's this like this conspiracy
has to go further um
and so you know it's not an
action-packed episode it's it's
not a whole bunch of fun but uh it's a
smartly written episode and
and I'd like to point out too before i
forget
this episode made me think about it was
that
in the measure of a man too is is i
prefer
episodes that are not a b story episodes
um in tv when you write an episode most
times there's an a story in a b
story where you have the a story is the
main story and then you cut
back tng episodes with a and b stories i
tend to
not like as much as when they focus all
42 minutes on a single story and that's
what the drumhead did it builds it up
yeah but it just depends on how it's
structured and what it's about yeah
if it if it needs a lot of big scenes
like measure
of man or you know where everyone's
talking and figuring something out
um or you're building up this
you know this drum head trial where
you're moving from one
person to the next and and you have to
show progression
you don't want to distract from that by
having you know deanna troy
her her replicator isn't making her
chocolate ice cream right
you know what I mean well that episode
is way too serious for something like
that yeah
yeah I just I just threw that out as a
silly example but maybe something like
different you know like you have one
story where data's experimenting with a
relationship and the b
story your your ensign is getting merged
with part of the whole
yeah that was that episode right that
was the yes
in theory yes the lady stuck on the
floor
those two things are totally wildly
different
they have nothing more to say
perhaps we should call a recess
what you got next rich all right well
what what I have next is I i would be uh
I'd be very sad if we didn't have a q
episode
and so I have deja q
it's a great episode it might not be the
best beginner episode
because if you're not familiar with q
the fact that he lost his powers might
not mean much to you
but if you're a fan of q it's a
delightful episode q of course
is is the omnipotent being he is he is
all-powerful all-knowing he could just
snap his fingers and he could do
anything
like a mariachi band appear like a
mariachi band appears
in deja queue yes
give riker some ladies then give him the
wharf
and he seems to be obsessed with picard
he's fascinated with humanity
and more specifically picard and he
frequently shows up on star trek the
next generation episodes
and they're usually lighthearted
episodes and he torments up
he torments everybody and they're really
fun episodes
q it's about time you showed up
i would prefer if you addressed me as
his honor the high sheriff of nottingham
he was a little more menacing early on
even even then though there were some
fun moments yeah yeah the first
the first appearance of q was the the
first episode of star trek yeah the
pilot and then the second one was when
he sent them all down to the planet so
when he made them fight pig monsters
yeah that was a very bad episode but it
was season one the
napoleonic pig warriors with the muskets
those aren't muskets
i don't he was tempting riker to become
a cue I think
i don't remember that one very well but
um his appearances became
less and less uh threatening and more
more and more benevolent as time went on
too oddly
first the first q appearance he is
clearly clearly the antagonist
and then by the time you get to the end
it's almost like he's guiding everybody
but deja q is an episode starts off
where the the enterprise they're in
orbit over this planet
and this planet is a huge problem
literally because their moon
is crashing into the planet so the
enterprise they're desperately trying to
figure out scientifically how to use
their tractor beams or whatever
just to save save this planet from their
moon crashing into it when
out of nowhere a naked queue appears on
the bridge of the enterprise
and he has been stripped of his powers
the the rest of the queue all of the
other queues have decided he is too much
of a menace he's terrible and they're
going to punish q by making him
mortal and so you have this wonderful
episode where like
the tables are reversed normally
normally q is the one fucking with
everybody and now
you have an episode where q is
completely powerless
and and he's completely confused by
everything like he doesn't know what
sleep is he's
he's terrified when he falls asleep i
lost consciousness what happened
you fell asleep q you fell asleep
oh terrifying how can you stand it day
after day
it's just got some great one-liners this
episode he was trying to prove to
everybody that he doesn't have his
powers anymore they won't
they won't believe that that q is
immortal now
and it's like how how can I prove it to
you and then worf just says
die what must I do to convince you
people
die
it's perfect oh very clever wharf
eat any good books lately whoever
thought wharf would have a witty
comeback
and then he says eat any good books yeah
lately
line makes me laugh too it's nowhere
near as clever no but it's just funny
yeah yeah this is also the episode where
you get the famous picard
facepalm because in all the universe
you're the closest thing I have to a
fringe on luke oh
that's in this episode when q shows up
on the bridge card's like
i got enough shit to deal with now what
what the fuck is
what what the fuck is you doing sneezing
having an itch
a pimple bad breath
having to bathe too bad
uh this is also a good example of a b
story
where they are they are more intertwined
um because q's appearance there
he they start making him help trying to
um
figure out how to pull the moon away
from
or back into a stable orbit and so he
he's actively working on the problem at
the end that the two stories
connect as they should as they usually
do that's what b
story is done well they think everything
comes together it comes together at the
end q
at the end he uh gets his powers back
hmm
fine you got your powers back
try and stay out of trouble and um he
solves their problem with the moon yeah
and shows it shows a little bit of uh
benevolence and kindness from him uh
they helped him out
they took care of him when he didn't
have his powers they protected him
most importantly why chose to become
human
yeah he knew he knew all of the other
people he tormented were going to be
coming after him
and and only only starfleet would be
gullible enough to take him in and help
him out
and space electric space fish or
whatever he'll
come to come to get him the uh
calamari catamari we have sustained
light damage from an attack by an alien
species known as the calamarine
well also it's also a good episode with
data yeah
because they they team queue up with
data in that episode and the
the irony is that q is this being who
has been
forced against his will to become a
human he doesn't want anything to do
with being human
and data his entire ambition in his life
has been to become
more human and now now you get scenes
with them together where
data's kind of teaching you how to be a
better human being
I'm not good in groups it's difficult to
work in a group when you're omnipotent
and um another uh note is the q
q moment of kindness is that this is the
same episode where it gives
data that moment of uh
humor laughter data understands laughter
for
just a minute and then it's taken away
from them
great pick rich thank you oh that is
that is
that is up there for me is that one of
your is that on your list
no wow however you did it
thank you
we're we'll segue with q okay and I'm
going with tapestry
i don't have it on my list but it's a
great episode written by ronald d moore
uh this is this is the the star trek's
quantum leap
episode uh
i love this episode it's so great
the premise is we opened with
uh the away team has been ambushed we
don't see it but they beam right into
sickbay
picard has been shot square in the chest
with some kind of
high-powered laser beam he's dying his
artificial heart
is giving specifically because he has an
artificial heart yeah and
um dr crusher can't save him he dies
he wakes up in a white landscape
and then q is there in like monk robes
and he's like I'm god you're dead it's
great opening
q's not wrong I  I mean for all practical
intents and purposes he is god
and it's and it's ambiguous at the end
whether or not picard actually
died or q played a trick on him we don't
really know
it's near the end of q's transformation
from pure antagonists to
secretly benevolent and they went so far
benevolent on q in that episode that
they had to say oh it was a dream and we
don't know if it was really cute or not
yeah we don't know if picard had a dream
if q really intervened and prevented him
from dying
who knows um he doesn't magically
recover in sickbay at the end but
um yeah so it's the star trek quantum
leap episode
he leaps back into his former self they
do a bit where he looks in the mirror
and I'm really glad they didn't they
didn't show a younger self it would have
been
copyright infringement um but he's like
he's like I don't
you know I don't look 21. he's like well
and everybody else you do
that's what q says suddenly don't look
it
well to everyone else you do so uh
basically it's a
uh it's kind of a time travel that he's
given q has given picard the opportunity
to be less brash in his youth to not get
into the fight
that caused him to need an artificial
heart right that's that's the
the heart of the episode it's also
it's also about all the like the choices
you make throughout your life
and how they mold you as a person
because picard looks back at his that
his younger self as brash
arrogant um violent even
he's a womanizer he makes a date with an
elderly lady
i know he had the hearts for his friend
he had the hots for his friend
he gets slapped in the face by a girl in
the beginning walks out
and then he remembers that he made he
drunkenly made a date with an elderly
lady
and he shows up and and and she
she's like she's like is am I not as
pretty as I was when you had beer
goggles
what's wrong I don't look as attractive
to you as I did last night
and he's like he's like no no no you're
you're a
handsome woman I think you're a very
handsome woman
handsome that's something you say to old
ladies
and then she she throws a drink in his
face or slaps him or something
she's like I'm out of here he bastard
and uh so yeah he's he's a bit of a
womanizer and I love that line
you're you're a very handsome
woman because to me
it's a lovely reference to the salt
vampire episode
of the original star trek series you
remember this
i don't remember this line that you're
referencing but I remember that episode
i love william shatner's delivery of
this line
in the salt vampire episode because they
go down to the planet to find that
scientist
and his wife is there and uh mccoy knew
her
when he was younger and it's not really
the wife it's the salt vampire in
disguise
and um he sees her as young and
beautiful
and kirk sees her as an old lady
oh this is captain jim kirk of the
enterprise
this is greater and and mccoy's like
she doesn't look a day over 25 when i
when I dated her
yeah 100 years ago and and and kirk's
like
and he goes because bones she's a
a handsome woman but you know he's just
like what the fuck are you talking about
she looks exactly as I knew her 12 years
ago
amazing jim like a girl at 25. she's got
some gray bones
excuse me professor she's a handsome
woman yes but hardly
25. and so you never say a woman is
handsome
it means it means they still look pretty
good when they're
old so that's what that's picard's first
mistake and so he's
he's he's a womanizer he's he's
arrogant he starts fights with nausicans
and so he becomes the the
the the killjoy of the party when he's
he's an old man
and everybody sees him as 21 year old
because he's hanging out with his two
cadet friends martha britannitis
and the guy with the red hair
i don't know what his name is bobby
whatever
point is though without without that
ambition of his youth without that fire
he he never made much of his life
cardi that won't solve anything they'll
teach him that he can't go around
cheating starfleet officers
all it'll do is provoke him
and provoking a nausea is not a good
idea so he's he's being more
older picard and he's saying the the
they do a thing where they're playing
dom jot which is like pool in a pool
hall basically
with with um play dumb shot you will
play come on
that's a famous line human
play dumb jet human
it's like darmac enchilada into an agra
a resistance is futile it has a famous
line in this one rich
ah dom jawed human and um
and the the the nausicans look silly
playing this little game with the
glowing balls
it's a terrible prop terrible but it's a
great line
it's a great line terrible prop great
line uh they find out the nausicans are
cheating
god I'm not here to help you I'm here to
stop you from making a serious mistake
you sound like my mother you know
picard's buddy is like pissed off about
it and he wants to get back at them and
no no let's not and then the fight is
about to happen
and picard stops his friend from
attacking the gnostic and like throws
him over a table
you know yeah he also sleeps with
with the girl which they never did they
were always friends and he kind of soils
that
friendship and it's it's ruined there as
well
and so then boom flash forward
mr picard lieutenant junior grade
mr wolfe what is my rank of position you
are lieutenant junior grade
assistant astrophysics officer
are you feeling all right he's got the
blue uniform on and he's like what
and so they show his future it's a
little bit too of like it's a wonderful
life where you kind of see how
if he was never born but now it's picard
is the changes he made didn't mold his
character and and
q explains it to him he's like if you
never did this you wouldn't have
taken command of the stargazer bridge
when the captain died and you wouldn't
you got you have to be seen you know and
then
riker explains it to him too he's like
you never take chances you never
you never you got to stand out you got
to get noticed you know yeah
if you want to get ahead you have to
take chances stand out in the crowd
get noticed it's a very simple
lovely story about the folly of regret
i can't live out my days as that person
that man is
bereft of passion
and imagination that is not who I am
the folly of regret yes it's regret is a
huge
part of this episode and and I watched
this one
live on television or you know first run
i guess yeah and I had known from the
samaritan snare episode
when when picard and wesley take the
shuttlecraft to get his heart fixed
by dr uh pulaski he tells the story
you fought them and won
i had this one norse again down in this
uh
somewhat devious joint lock when uh
unbeknownst to me one of his chums
drew his weapon and impaled me through
the back
of how he got stabbed in the heart and
he looked down and he laughed
in fact I do actually remember that i
laughed out loud
and when I saw that scene I was like
he's got to look down and laugh
and then it happened I was like okay
okay
I'm watching your canon already star
trek the next generation
that was a undisciplined
loud-mouthed opinionated young man who
was way out of his league
quality quality callback it was it was
accurate
they knew their canon they knew it as
they were writing it
that show was not its fucking a game man
senior officers please report to the
captain's ready room
acknowledged there's so there and
there's just
there's some touches of humor I just i
love when picard
realizes in the future that he's a
nobody yeah
and you know mr picard and he's asking
what year is it
who's the captain of this ship and
they're just like the fog
and he's like pleading with riker to
like you know give him a chance and
you know nah it's too late he wrote and
riker's like just like desperately
searching for compliments he's like
you're
punctual punctual
and he does this like like you know look
on his face see that's
that's all these little moments like
when when riker and troy are kind of
like talking to picard and they're you
know giving him an evaluation
even though it's in an appropriate time
there's riker's just like he's like well
you know yeah like little little human
character moments and that's stuff you
don't get from
modern star trek not to bring up the bad
i don't know I think it would have been
better
if picard turned to the nausea and said
please friend
choose to live and then pulled out a
sword and just started decapitating
everybody in the bar
that would have been better yeah and
then q's like what
oh my god what are you doing nothing
changed I had this whole thing set up
i was wrong about humanity I have to
destroy you all
i like when the noskin says to them you
talk and you talk
like all star fleet you talk and you
talk
but you have no grandma but you have no
groundbar
one of my favorite lines
blu-ray star trek
i don't have the blu-rays well here's
the thing you can
still buy these on blu-ray uh this is
this is my pitch to not
watch this on star uh cbs all access
blu-rays oh it's on netflix is it yeah
that's all I've been well I saw when we
watched some of them watch on netflix or
buy the blu-rays the blu-rays are
wonderful
and I thought some of the effects looked
nice they might be the newer
cleaned up versions on netflix yeah I'm
not I'm not 100 sure on that
i was watching this episode and I could
go through the whole series and look for
little things I love
looking at details on the sets that are
like
messed up or not proper where you could
see like the carpet
cut you know like stuff like that and i
noticed um
that he sits down on the bed with the
girl and I noticed on the base of the
bed there's like black scuff marks
from their boots hitting it probably
doing multiple takes the things you
don't notice
the the they're at the bar and um picard
and the girl both have like similar
glasses but the guy
has a klingon blood wine cup
which I thought was neat something I've
never noticed before it's probably like
okay maybe this bar had that cup
randomly
or more likely that's just a cup prop
they happen to have in the back and they
needed more costs right right
yeah
So the Blu-rays are great.
And it's funny.
In, uh, I saw, I posted a wonderful clip on our patreon.
It's from the episode, uh, I think, is it, is it Data's Day?
I've watched that recently.
That was one of my candidates.
It didn't make the list.
When Data is, um, he's, he's, yeah, it is Data's Day, when he's, when he's typing a journal to Bruce Maddox.
Yeah.
And Keiko and, uh, Miles are getting married.
And then there's the Vulcan Ambassador on board.
"Vulcan Ambassador."
They bring that up in The Drumhead.
So it's funny they reference that, because there's a wonderful little shot in that episode, Data's Day, when the Vulcan Ambassador is standing on the bridge and talking to the viewscreen, to the Romulan, and she is like, she's like, I'm an actress lady.
I'm talking like a Vulcan.
Blah blah blah blah.
And behind her in the background is Picard, just standing there, and Patrick Stewart falls asleep in the shot.
He nods off.
Cuz it's not his line. 
He's just standing there, and this lady's probably doing 20 takes.
And he, and he's just, he goes like this.
Like that.
And it's like, ah, Blu-ray.
