are you okay
yeah, i'm fine
we should probably tell everyone we're wearing these masks not because of coronavirus but because we've been cleaning the studio
yes, which is why i'm wearing a filthy old stained shirt with fucked up hair
is that why you look so disgusting today
yes more so than usual
um yeah so we've been doing a deep clean on the studio and uh organizing things throwing stuff out
and i i walked upstairs and you and jay were talking about something and i walked in the room and you said wait wait wait no let's film this
well yeah
so i have no idea what's going on
rich doesn't
but i figured i would film this with you instead of jay because you and i have history with this subject matter
oh oh
this is our firstand last video about jerry springer
oh jerry springer
during my cleaning i uncovered something: my jerry springer book called ringmaster
uh his his disgusting cash-in book
jerry springer
disgusting cash-in
no
which mostly contains pictures and large-print text
um and the sickening thing is i got this autographed
where did you get that autographed
i i figured that was something somebody sent us
you actually bought that and had it autographed
i went to best buy in the chicagoland area
a book-signing at best buy
he had a book-signing at best buy
he had to buy his book, ringmaster
and then he signed your book and you left
i didn't even talk to him
i didn't
you know
it was youryour typical book-signing
thank god there wasn't a reading beforehand as as as happens a lot at book signings
you know the author goes up to a podium and reads a passage
uh no
no no no no
that that wasn't going to happen with ringmaster
for the zoomers out there like i'm assuming there's a lot of kids don't even know who the fuck jerry springer is
well that's the thing is rich you and i rich and i would film like home movies after after school
yeah
like we'd make little short comedy videos in my parents basement and every day we would come home from school we'd get we'd pick up lunch and we'd watch jerry springer
but we watched jerry springer during the heyday when he he started off in the early 90's and then a couple years later things went out of control
for a while he had he had a legitimate talk show
i mean you know sleazy but it was a talk show
right
and then it just evolved into just bringing on trash
and the trash would yell and scream at each other
and fight
and then he'd just stand there like
his his goal was to get people to fight
yes of course
i i remember one episode very specifically where on the left side of the stage was
a black family and on the right side of the stage were ku klux klan members
and that was and i think the dialogue lasted about five seconds before everybody started punching each other
"here they are again the national imperial wizard of the kkk"
"jeff is his name"
"his wife edna"
"their daughter tanya"
"and her boyfriend jt"
he had the one talk show on tv where you knew the name of the security guard
right
so jerry springer
i don't know where he is now
ironically he started his life with with a horrible embarrassing controversy
uh
this behavior this particular incident
certainly sets
a bad example for anybody else to follow
and one which i am obviously not very
proud of
he was the mayor of cincinnati i think
what ended his career was that
he had sex with a prostitute and he got
caught because he paid her with a check
uh and then i think later in his career
he did a show
called like dirty baggage or baggage
and it was like it was almost like a
dating game show where there was like
a contestant and like three it's like a
guy and three women or
vice versa and they'll have like a
briefcase and they would open the
briefcase up or
or a card or something it would be like
i used my vibrator four times a day uh
something embarrassing about themselves
i once you know and so
then it would be like are they lying
about that or you know
so it was a to tell the truth kind of
show kind of i think i never watched it
i didn't i've seen it here and there and
i don't think it was very
i had no idea this even existed it
continued on his legacy of sleaze
i slept with my girlfriend's twin
sister he's not gay because you could
you could tell that at some point he
just stopped caring
oh yeah especially entirely on the jerry
springer show yes
and then there were there were
controversies rumors
theories that eventually some of the
trash that ended up on the show were
actors
sometimes you could really tell when
people were acting sometimes you could
really tell when they're
real wasn't there a whole scandal when
it was
revealed that a group that was on were
all paid actors
i think i kind of remember that probably
but then then there are some people that
look
very rough physically
and you can tell and by the way they
speak and they can't give them very much
i i don't know what somebody's motive
would be to go on that show
just to degrade themselves that way
um hey maybe maybe they get more than a
an applebee's gift card maybe they get
like you know a couple hundred bucks
you go on the show you humiliate
yourself on tv and someone's gonna try
and punch you in the face
and you're gonna look like a
so yeah that's just a little recap on
jerry springer um

literature

into the relationship
this is when it starts getting people
just hitting each other uh i remember
when uh jerry rescues an obese man
i don't remember remember that they had
he was you know
he did out of kindness not out of
exploitation
that's so people could gawk at the 600
pound man that they're
lifting out of the side of the house he
was bigger than that but they cut him
out of
his trailer all right we can start now

audience all right well let's bring out
your sister
who's been watching so she knows what's
going on here's
what the barbie what you thinking
i can i can just i appreciate the fact
that jerry springer is completely
lacking in
either tact or subtlety
there has never been someone just so
blatantly sleazy
[Laughter]
yeah he ruined a lot of people's lives
except for steve wilkos he got a tv show
he got his own tv show
yeah he probably made it made some bucks
um but you know all those people that
got beat up on tv
for an applebee's gift card
[Laughter]
i guess it's a story to tell their you
know their friends at in the next
trailer over
you know i was on jerry springer once
it's that's gotta be
just the allure of being on tv
