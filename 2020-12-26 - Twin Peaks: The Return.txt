well josh we're finally here we got our donuts we got our coffee and we're gonna we're gonna try and solve this mystery
yes we're ready for an investigation
yes yes
well that's nice
three days old
oh oh good
still hot
burning right in there
that's great
"i saw them in a room"
"dirty bearded men in a room"
we're gonna do it we're gonna talk about
twin peaks we've waited long enough
we've thought about it we've watched it
a few times
i think we were discussing we've maybe
done we're going to say approximately
three and a half times each
yes all together for season three bits
and pieces yeah
it's one of those things where it's one
it just felt overwhelming
to try and condense into a concise video
with some sort of structure to it um
but also not ruin it for people that's
also true really give people time to see
it
yeah and now i think people have this
whole thing is going to be spoilers
we're going to talk about it as if
you've seen it there's no reason to do
it any other way
yeah and first thing right off the bat i
want to mention this because
there's already been 500 comments about
it uh
yes we're aware of the four hour
five hour everything about twin peaks
definitely
concretely explained video uh
no no interest in it no i don't
i don't need it explained well that's
that's the thing is i watched a little
bit of it just to get a feel for it
cause i'm not gonna [ __ ] on it if i
haven't watched any of it sure
um and if it'd be one thing if it's just
here's my theory about what the show is
about
because it's about the whole show not
just season three right the whole yeah
and it's like okay that's your theory
you have a thesis you're finding ways to
connect everything that's fine
but it's presented in such a smug and
reductive way where it's like this is
definitely what it all means
oh god and here's some out of context
quotes from david lynch that are
basically unrelated that i'm connecting
to it
and the the central thesis being that
the entire series is about
is a meta-narrative about violence on tv
which i think that's a part of it that's
absolutely definitely a matter of aspect
to it but it's like connecting
everything to that robs the show of so
many things that make it wonderful
including its entire emotional core yeah
so i i i watched a little bit of it i
couldn't take it anymore
okay we're not here to give you answers
uh i don't know i looked at the comments
and it's like
so many people are like thank you now i
know what it all means and i don't have
to think anymore
it's just so antithetical to everything
i love
dearly about david lynch's work not just
twin peaks yeah but that's
and that's a was a big part of the
initial experience of watching it
um when we did because we were we were
watching it together a group of us
and it was it was number one it was nice
to be taken back to kind of that
that weekly tv structure that we grew up
with you know i mean maybe it's
nostalgia i guess whatever but
i wouldn't have necessarily wanted to
watch the whole thing in a row because
we needed time to process and think
about it
and discuss it and then you know i'd go
talk with with other people that have
watched it you know and like and it was
it was
they used to call it water cooler tv you
know if if any show benefits from that
format that old school tv format it's
this one
yeah because that was yeah me a couple
other friends every week we'd get to
get together and watch it afterwards
we'd discuss it and try and make
some sort of sense out of it yeah and
it'd just be like just the excitement
just like what do you think that was oh
man
i think well maybe it was this like well
i don't know if it was that you know
just being being able to really like dig
into it
like cooper's definitely coming back
next week
he's drinking the coffee that's going to
trigger totally going to be his
cut to 16 episodes later
was it the next episode where the only
shot of dougie was just him getting hit
in the face by the baseball
that's another thing is it's weird to
talk about it as episodes because i mean
it is
but it feels like an 18-hour movie it
feels like a natural extension of what
david lynch was starting to do with like
inland empire right it's just getting
long
and out of control yeah and it's and
it's it's episodic
connected like i mean i would i would
consider inland empires
somewhat episodic where it's like well
now she's here and now she's here and
now she's here yeah well that's
by virtue of the fact that he made it it
wasn't intended to be a feature he was
just kind of experimenting with
his cheap crappy digital camera and
that's kind of what makes them so
fascinating is having all these random
ideas and then
finding ways to sort of connect them all
and i you know i i don't necessarily
know how much of that is him and how
much of that is mark frost you can't
really
can't say um but it seems to have helped
having mark frost around
oh yeah and that's yeah that's we should
recap the story
uh because there is a story yeah i feel
like we mentioned this whenever we talk
about david lynch other people that
don't like him just ah it's all just
weird nonsense oh no it's there's a
definite story and there's just a lot of
flavor around there's there's always a
core story that you can connect with and
then everything else kind of you know
branches off from that
i love ideas i like a story that's got
some concrete you know
structure but also holds abstractions
life is filled with abstractions and the
way we make heads or tails of it is
through intuition and so uh
people get used to a film that pretty
much
explains itself a hundred percent
and they kind of turn off that you know
beautiful thing of intuition
when they're looking at a film that has
some abstractions
these pictures and sounds flowing along
together
in time in a sequence making a thing
that can only really be said in cinema
it's much broader than this but the the
basic story is
25 years after the events of season two
at the end of that season of course
cooper has been uh
replaced by bob or as we learn in this
not really bob but the same sort of evil
spirit that
uh bob represents it becomes a question
of what bob is
not specifically bob yeah we can get
into that but
evil cooper has now been out in our
world or the world of twin peaks which
might be different than our world which
we'll get into when we talk about meta
stuff
um but he's been out just causing
trouble for 25 years 25 years of
international
uh intrigue and and just bad stuff
all around the world he's he's he's a
real son of a [ __ ] oh man
uh but now because these are the rules
of
the other place i guess 25 years go by
you have to go back
and uh the real cooper gets to come back
to his world
you're going to be replaced but evil
cooper's thought ahead
he's got a plan and that plan's name is
dougie he created
what we learned is called a tulpa what's
happening to me
which is a direct copy of yourself so
direct
i mean as far as physical appearance as
far as physical appearance yeah
yeah so he's made a tulpa of himself
so that when real cooper tries to come
back in the world he will replace dougie
and not evil cooper and evil cooper
can continue to be in our world or the
twin peaks world
and continue to wreak havoc indefinitely
and that's that's the basic story
what the hell that's extremely basic and
then you throw on top of that
you know the the actual town of twin
peaks and how the the lack of any sort
of
bright uh positive cooper type character
is kind of corrupted things
brought it's kind of like this rock
that's been forming under the uh
under the surface it's a much darker
place than we're used to
and uh and it ends up being a battle of
light versus dark
good versus evil it's david lynch's the
stand
the stephen king story the stand gosh
i didn't even thought of that until now
but a really good yeah that works
we saw this on that little slip paper we
took out a major briggs's tube
what is this you don't ever want to know
about that
the first time you watch it you're like
what you don't know what's happening
you're just trying to try to follow it
as best you can
on rewatch it all makes so much more
sense oh yeah the story is so much more
clear
and it's all set up right from that that
opening scene with uh cooper and the
firemen
everything that pays off in the last two
episodes is set up in that scene
listen to the sounds
remember
richard linda but yeah so
it's it's it's set up right there and
then
and then off you go we see some old
characters we see some new characters
we'll get into those and there's all
sorts of different story lines that
especially when it first starts out
everything feels so disconnected
from each other it's very almost to the
point where you're like is this
intentional or is this
kind of just not working yes it's so
stark
there's no music for the first like
three or four episodes there's some
ambience here and there
but it's it's very off-putting right off
the bat yeah and i think that ends up
adding to the thrill of when everything
starts to be
drawn together because it is that far
splayed out where it's just like
here's new york here's south dakota
here's vegas
are we ever going to get the twin peaks
yeah nothing's going on there right now
that's okay
you're not important yet we'll get there
but it's and it yeah it really takes its
time which
i think was probably a big turn off to
some people oh man
and about again on rewatching it it's so
deliberate
it was really so much more clear on the
second time just like
when you're not waiting every second for
dougie to turn into proper cooper
then you could really enjoy it yeah and
you have that have that anticipation
you know removed you don't have to worry
about it so then you get to
really focus on what the story is doing
a lot more and it's
god it was so much funnier the second
time
funnier and darker yeah it's it's
possibly the the darkest like david
lynch has ever done
i think i said this when we talked about
firewalk with me but it's like because
that was before the new season came out
and i was like you know don't expect
this this isn't going to be twin peaks
season three in the conventional sense
of
here's all the characters you love and
here's the continuation of that story
and it's like
it's not gonna be that it's this is not
quirky twin peaks anymore this is
a dark dark place uh because there's no
light in this world cooper kind of
represents that positive light and
he's been absent for 25 years and
everything's just turned to [ __ ]
the [ __ ] kind of neighborhood is this
people are under a lot of stress bradley
there's all the stuff like at the road
house we keep getting throughout the
series these little
little vignettes that don't really
connect any of the main story lines
no but thematically they connect and
just showing how kind of dark this world
is turned
i mean that's some of my favorite stuff
on the show yeah well first off the road
the roadhouse is a hipster bar now
apparently that's dark
oh there's all these [ __ ] fashion
bands
we're just gonna put on sharp-dressed
man and everybody's gonna dance
actually that's pretty awesome yeah i
want to say that that mc guy
he's great he's dancing to sharp just
bad but yeah all those and those scenes
too
as far as kind of mentioned it's more of
like a 18-hour movie than it is a
traditional tv show
yeah as far as it doesn't have that it's
like here's a scene here's another it
doesn't have that like structure
episode to episode no so those little
scenes at the end of each episode with
the roadhouse and a band performing
it's it's it's kind of a palette
cleanser yeah it's a nice way to like
okay we're winding down now and
especially after because i was
you know optimistic but hesitant when it
was returning and so by the time you get
to the end of that it's the first two
episodes they aired as one long thing
yeah and you get to the end of that
episode and we're in the roadhouse and
there's
that chromatic song playing and it's
like okay it was like being wrapped in a
warm blanket
okay this whole thing's gonna be all
right take her out he's not gonna [ __ ]
this up
which is something to point out that
idea of like someone returning to an old
franchise or an old property and
just not not working the same way not
you know
i mean this doesn't work the same way
but that's by design it works its own
way
it feels a lot more informed by david
lynch's film work
necessarily than like anything tv even
even like the first couple seasons of
twin peaks honestly oh yeah
um another thing that kind of struck me
as more of a more of a film thing as
opposed to a tv thing at least in twin
peaks
the first two seasons were all score as
far as i remember
um but this you know you get at the end
of every episode you get a song like a
modern band doing a song
you get very popular songs
the great use of take five during the
during the coffee scene oh yeah
it's like that's nothing that i'm used
to from david lynch so that was really
something
yeah i mean he's used i think of like
lost highway which
that movie kind of had one of those
soundtracks like the crow where it's
like the soundtrack's more popular than
the movie yeah
like who's on that it's like marilyn
manson and all these like big names yeah
but then like roy orbison
yeah that's true you have weird stuff in
there too or something but yeah like
like a combination of yeah industrial
metal and 50s classics
yeah which i guess that contrast makes
the soundtrack interesting
but yeah this definitely feels more
informed by
his movie stuff than it does the
original series
sure and also possibly you know him
having spent a lot of time
focusing on music you know um and
definitely like a lot of those a lot of
those bands that show up at the end are
on the same label he's on
kind of like you know in that similar
sort of scene
that he uh stumbled into basically but
by inventing it you know 20 years 25
years ago 30 years ago
all those little vignettes and that's my
favorite one it's the charlene e one
where it's just so
she's just sitting there and she's so
like meek and these just big biker guys
just i'm waiting for somebody they just
pick her up and put her on the floor and
she's so
defeated she doesn't even try and stand
up yeah and then she's crawling that
like that like guttural
scream
yeah that i like i like what you're
saying there the overall rot of the town
and like why but it's interesting too
because like you think about how the
what the roadhouse was in the first
couple of seasons like it was you know
it was a rough place
you know there's there's the pink room
back there and and the bad stuff happens
like is that the green room now for the
bands you think
i was like time doesn't mean anything
but we do need to go on like 20.
but you know you think about what that
place sort of represents in twin peaks
and what it you know what it's supposed
to be 25 years later and it's all you
know filled with the next generation but
there is still that undercurrent of
of uh not filth exactly but grime or
like danger
yeah well it's leaked out into more of
twin peaks too i mean there's some of
this that almost feels like
apocalyptic like like i mentioned the
stand earlier like there's that part
when
uh bobby and uh shelly are in the diner
with their daughter and that
that a gunshot goes through the window
and bobby goes out to investigate
i didn't know it was a gun he could have
killed himself he could have killed
all of us husband and wife and they're
arguing because there's a gun in the car
there's lots of stuff about guns in this
yes i think that that's a big thing it's
just like how overwhelming
violence has become in this world it's
really permeated and drugs
drugs are a big part of it
but yeah that whole scene like bobby
goes out there and the couple's just
screaming at each other and then the car
behind him with
that crazy lady and it's like a zombie
in the passenger seat this kid of hers
she's sick
it's like spewing up something and like
bobby doesn't even know what to make of
any of this
there are two great in the whole series
for me they're two great
uh audience surrogate moments and that's
one of them
because we're feeling the same thing at
bobby's it's just like
what the [ __ ] is happening what is
happening in my town yeah
i'm supposed to be in charge i'm
supposed to know everything i can't
deal with any of this yeah like it's
just too much and the other one of
course
um when hawk has gotten everything out
of the laura palmer
archive has it all up on the table in
the break room and uh
lucy panics because uh while she was
pregnant she uh
she sneaked a chocolate bunny out of the
out of the out of the evidence and ate
it
and she's so sad and she's worried she's
going to go to prison and everything and
hawk finally just calms her down and
she's like it's not about the bunny do
chocolate bunnies have anything to do
with your heritage
no it's not about the bunny
it's not about the bunny
is it about the bunny
just about the buddy which i swear to
god should have been just a 30 second
promo on show time for the show
just twin peaks season three is it about
the bunny
no it's not about the bunny
and that's one of those scenes like
maybe the pacing of it is different than
people would expect from
if you're looking at it compared to the
original show but that's what
there is a lot of twin peaksy stuff in
it like a scene like that
reminds me so much of the original
series definitely uh or even things like
uh one of the last episodes when when
cooper's in the hospital bed and
every character like janie e's in there
his kids are in there and then like the
mitchum brothers show up with their
their las vegas not show girls but
whatever they are they're waitresses and
their whole outfits
um i mean they're kind of they're like
show girl yes
whatever they are like assistants yeah
yeah their personal assistants
just always dress like that but they're
all just in this little hospital room
it's like this is so weird
yeah just the chaos yeah because yeah
that yeah that did feel like something
that could have almost like a that marx
brothers feeling
yeah that would pop up in the first few
in the first couple seasons as well
it's it's hard for a show to balance
that really well
and uh twin peaks is you know a good
example of
of how well you can balance just you
know just
some terrifying things with some
completely ridiculous things
well that's that's the whole thing that
balance of light and dark
but then the other thing i wanted to
connect there that i can actually also
connect
to the to the break room you know to the
to having all the all the uh laura
palmer evidence
is uh probably my favorite improved
actor it's dana ashbrook
he's one of my favorite characters on
this season it's so wonderful because
number one he's completely changed he's
now he's now
on the good side of the law he's an
upstanding citizen he's a cop
he's you know he was the he was the bad
boy of town he was
drug dealing killing people he killed a
guy he came he killed a guy
probably killed a guy bobby killed a guy
um rebelling against his parents you
know all that and now he's uh you know
upstanding members of member town he's
uh he's
been been with the cops for clearly for
a while he's also the only returning
character
to get because this this show is like
the anti-nostalgia
show yeah like when they introduce or
when they cut the scenes with characters
from the original series they're not
given any sort of like
fanfare it's not like look here's dr
jacoby the first time you see him is in
this like
wide shot of dr jacoby walking out of
his little trailer yeah and
it just cuts to the characters without
any sort of any sort of like uh
reminder it's just like they're still
they still exist in this world
it's not a big deal van horn's still in
the [ __ ] lodge in his office where
he's been for the last 25 years exactly
doing the same [ __ ]
the only character that there's an
exception for with that is bobby
bobby
and i think it's because his character
has taken such a turn from where he was
on the original show
he does so well in playing the little
subtle things perfectly
it's back in that scene where he's where
he's talking with shelly and their
daughter
and he's got just you can tell he's got
just that little
flicker of like maybe he could get back
with shelly and things would be great
again and then she runs off to
to make out with balthazar getty and he
just deflates
yeah so good so good
and he's got one of the most tough
[ __ ] beats to pull off
it could have been so bad when he he
wheels into that
boardroom and sees the picture laura
palmer
man brings back some memories
it's so like perfectly done because
that's it's like episode
four three or four yeah but up until
that point like we were talking about
the music and how it's so
stark barely there and uh
i mean the show is called twin peaks the
return and it feels like it's kind of
very slowly
i mean you have coop slowly returning
you have the uh the the the
balance of light and dark very slowly
returning yeah you're on that same pace
yeah and even like down to the because
that's the first time we get any of the
like classic twin peaks music
is when bobby comes in and he sees that
and it's like oh
and he says he's like brought up some
old feelings and it's like
it's it's not it's not baiting with you
with nostalgia it's using these things
you recognize
to enhance the emotion of the scene yeah
to put you perfectly put you right there
yeah of people that are returning coming
back it was you know obviously
there is a certain nostalgia to be like
oh it's still it's still hawk and it's
still andy and it's still lucy
um but they feel so natural in their
parts though like they would still be
working here yeah
absolutely and i love kind of the
division there in the
in the police station where you got to
go around and turn the corner to get to
the modern part of the police station
where the [ __ ] are well this is one
[ __ ] but it kind of colors the whole
thing
[ __ ] chad [ __ ] chad she didn't
used to be like this
you didn't know that their son committed
suicide yeah i heard something about
that
he couldn't take being a soldier
really fascinated by you know how
shelley's
relationships have changed major like
amick did such a great job
worried about like oh our daughter's
amanda seyfried like huh yeah she's just
got a couple scenes it's okay
not a big deal um she does fine um
not her husband another [ __ ] slimy
guy
he's like get out i feel like he's
always that he's an antiviral
the brandon kronenberg movie okay he's
always that kind of guy
he plays it well he's he's perfect in
this but those two yeah
amanda seyfried and him or another kind
of like just showing like the
the the darker underbelly that's kind of
been bubbling
and then harry dean stanton i think we
were pretty sure at the time
that uh he didn't have any lines given
to him
go be in the show do whatever you're
going to do
be here he didn't stand [ __ ]
nightmare
well this is the new fat trout trailer
park yes it's moved because logistically
i don't think he would be anywhere near
twin peaks in the original
uh in fire walkway right no so but he's
come back
for some reason he's moved near twin
peaks to open up a new trailer park
i think he's in in the extended like
mark frost lore he's from there oh okay
yeah all right because like there's a
thing about in there's a thing in
the pre-show book where there are three
kids that get abducted by aliens
and one of which is carl and one of
which is the log lady oh interesting
yeah okay
and we well i want to talk about that a
little more here and there but again
that's it's mark frost's
twin peaks not david lynch's twin piece
right so you take that take
i've heard cause he did yeah he did a
book that came out before the new season
and then he did a book afterwards which
i just read okay so we can talk about
that
i haven't read any of those i've heard
there's some inconsistencies between
characters and stuff from his stuff in
the
the final the season yeah and you
basically
you take those as an interesting
alternative theory
like not quite fan fiction like insider
fan fiction basically
okay i would say it's like it's what he
wants to write
it's fine it's not exactly
you know um part of the story but it's
authorized okay
it's seven o'clock do you know where
your freedom is
you know jacoby is is so wonderful he's
lost it
he's oh he's in such a great way that's
the thing like some of the characters
that have just gone completely nuts it's
i love it it's so engaging
like he's got he's got he's got a very
specific plan and it seems to work
you know it works on nadine anyway
that's the yeah that's the he's
introduced because there's some
characters like audrey horn doesn't show
up till
over halfway through the season and we
were waiting we're like where's audrey
she's got to show up right she did and
she did
we'll get into it or did she but uh yeah
but uh
dr jacoby shows up pretty early or it's
almost like he's going to be a major
part of the show
he's not he's kind of on the sidelines
um and
like i said the first time you see him
it's just like this massive wide shot
and then we cut to him like
spray painting shovels and you're like
what is this
he says very methodically that's a lot
he's rigged up this whole contraption
using like an old uh like swing set and
then like
bike tires so that's the whole system
that moves the uh
that moves the shovels this
is your shiny gold shovel two coats
guaranteed shovel your way
out of the [ __ ] it
sets off the series of events that needs
to happen
where like if he wasn't there nadine
wouldn't self-actualize all of a sudden
out of after all these years even though
her her uh
drape store seems to be doing quite well
yeah um
but so she's able to go and set big ed
free so he can be with norma
but i've been a selfish [ __ ] to you
all these years and you've been a saint
what and so that has to that's basically
like
the whole reason that's there yeah you
know it's to make this thing happen at
the end
other than that it's just it's just a
fun little thing for an actor to do
and come on who doesn't want to shovel
themselves out of the [ __ ]
but i did i did feel like a lot of that
was kind of like a lot of the uh the cut
scenes
from firewalk with me that we eventually
that we finally got i wanted
a two by four
that's what those scenes kind of feel
like to me although they do eventually
point to something
yeah but that's the stuff that you you
you know you got to cut that out of a
feature film
when you're doing 18 hours unfiltered
uncut david lynch yeah you got the time
throw those scenes in there
the whole scene like whole first scene
with ben and jerry horn oh yeah
it's just and it's that's totally what
that is to me it's just
you know jerry's been growing growing
the good stuff
and he is on it yeah crew boy
is that mother's hat well jerry's story
line is funny that's one of those like
really really long drawn out what ends
up being a joke because the whole way
he spends the entire series lost in the
woods
i don't know where i am
go away
and then towards the very end he
accidentally stumbles onto the plot of
the show
yeah when he runs into dale to evil
cooper
which he wanders all the way to what
like north dakota something like that
from from montana but we just
occasionally just cut to him in the
woods he's
arguing with his foot whatever and
you're like this is
you're thinking like this isn't going to
connect to anything and then it just
he wanders right into the plot whoops
it's it's a way of like catching up with
the characters from the original show
that feels so like natural and organic
yes without it it's not like we got to
put this character in like they're
you know donna doesn't show up no and
why would she why would she because they
couldn't get married kelly
i don't know i know they couldn't get
lara flynn you don't want to get larry
but uh but yeah like you know it's not
like we got to put these characters in
there because people expect them
it's david lynch putting him in there
because he loves well he loves these
actors but he loves these characters too
and just wants to wants to see what
they're doing these days yeah
yeah and luckily um you know um
that's not the case now but a lot of a
lot of people were still around
at the time that could participate you
know um although michael honking decided
he didn't want to but then he got
robert forster who perfect he's great
i mean everything yeah he's robert
forester so he
walks in and owns that role so perfectly
um
i couldn't imagine anybody doing a
better job during the wally brando
seeing the rubber forester
my shadow is always with me
sometimes ahead sometimes behind
except on cloudy days
or at night
yes well it's so it's it's
exactly what you need to set that off
he's just so patient yep michael sarah
just keeps babbling
about it he didn't even want to talk to
him he wanted to talk to harry yeah
but that's yeah that's something too
with with uh
having robert forster i mean one this is
like
almost every actor that david lynch has
ever worked with shows up in this
a lot of them do like balthazar getty
was in lost uh
highway yeah and uh and robert foster i
kind of forgot he's in mulholland drive
it's briefly he's a cop in it him and uh
something briscoe i can't really actor's
name but okay they're cops in mulholland
drive they both show up in this
but pointing out that yeah we don't have
um
uh harry on this season for whatever
reason that actor didn't want to come
back
and it's like they could have just
written anything like oh he retired or
he moved to another town
they very pointedly and this ties in
when you talk about some of these actors
that have died
they make a point of saying that he's
sick and airy
do me a favor
beat this thing and i feel like that's
another reoccurring thing on this season
is is sickness death the passing of time
yeah definitely there's so many people
so many characters on the show that are
sick
so many actors that couldn't come back
because they've passed away
you know some of them a long time ago
some you know right i mean david bowie
died right before this happened
catherine coulson i'm dying
sorry margaret
you know about death
that it's just a change
not an end man talk about fearless
like her scenes in this just they rip
your heart out every time you cut to her
they do and it's it's it's it's you know
it's
really wonderful that she felt like she
had the you know the strength and energy
to do that because it wouldn't have been
the same show without her
yeah even just the brief shots i mean
that's yeah i think even people that
aren't into twin peaks they know the log
lady like that's
the the most kind of uh well yeah you
can pinpoint the quirkiness of the show
oh this character that gets messages
from her log like
she's the heart of the whole thing when
they were showing it on a e
back in the 90s yeah like she was the
host and she
cut little you know intros for the whole
whole seasons yeah
and the fact that she could be able to
do that in you know in the unfortunate
you know
health that she was in was just a
blessing it's it's a
a testament not to not just to like how
much david lynch loves this world and
these characters but
the people he's collaborated with too
definitely
the only other hayward in the show apart
from gersten
briefly yeah um doctor dr hayward has
moved out of town
which i assume was the only way they
could do it so they just uh set up
literally skype in his performance yeah
because he died shortly after this too
yep he was in he was in pretty ill
health yeah
um erdeen stanton died shortly after
this mm-hmm
miguel ferreira was he died pretty close
to it miguel ferreira yeah it's
it's crazy how many people and i think
and like i said i think that's kind of
one of the themes of the season is yeah
just
everybody's getting older the passing of
time so it's it's great that he was able
to get all these people together
and then to give major roles to people
that he knows are dead
yeah major briggs is one of the key
components of this season and he died
forever
ago really long time ago yeah he's been
there for like 20 years
and he's key we can't get david bowie
back [ __ ] it he's a tea kettle now
fine michael janderson's a weirdo
doesn't want to be in it
he's a tree he's a [ __ ] tree
that's great why wouldn't he be he
evolved it's fine
who are you to say that he's wrong you
know
but having you know having such a show
that yeah you're able to
take these leaps that you might not be
able to do in another narrative yeah
and you're able to capitalize on them
like this
there's a lot of like telephonic
communication in this
in in there a lot of uh that reminds
reminds me of like kind of um
what would be considered kind of a retro
thing because you know there's obviously
people are texting and and
you know text messages and and that kind
of thing are important but uh
you know there's a whole methodical
thing where where evil coop like
busts out the old telephone that's in
the suitcase and hooks it up and this
and that and the other thing yeah
and that takes like five minutes and
you're watching do every little bit of
it because we have time
then there's yeah the the whole
technology stigle to the show
is interesting because uh you know
there's there's multiple
realities or multiple dreams or whatever
you want to call them i feel like in
david lynch's minds
it's all kind of the same thing as far
as different worlds different universes
different
it's all electricity
yeah it all yeah you travel through
electricity but a dream an alternate
reality it's all kind of the same thing
and i think that's one of the key ways
of understanding that the world of twin
peaks not the town but the world that
most of the show takes place and is
different than like our world
is kind of shown with these technology
things like yeah what you're talking
about with evil cooper and
his whole convoluted suitcase but that
seems super important that it's
landline telephonic yeah but then but
then other other stuff in the world too
like
uh he has a tracking device and it's
just like three random shapes and it
looks so cheap
and then like uh jane adams who we
haven't mentioned who plays the corner
in south dakota
but like her whole uh computer system
for
uh oh yeah it looks like windows 95 yeah
yeah so there's
it looks like our world but there's
these little things that make the
technology just feel like completely
different
well i do i do feel like that's sort of
like it's supposed to point you at
certain things like
you know um and again it's like you turn
the corner in the in
in the police office in twin peaks and
there's the modern stuff it's been
isolated
yeah it's put away the sheriff's desk
you know wood
normal and then the screen he's got his
little wood lever
yeah so it's like okay so you found a
way to integrate it into your
you know design yeah um but it's
with the wooden lever that still feels
like old technology just don't try and
explain cell phones to lucy
she doesn't get it no she doesn't until
she does
until she does she finally eventually
does which is one of the brilliant
things about
lucy god and that's the one of the
things about lucy
that i like carried through from the
first two seasons to this one
is that you can never underestimate her
because you gotta remember she's the one
in season two that just like
was just discreetly typing up a
conversation that was happening in front
of her
and nobody you know she wasn't supposed
to know that but she wasn't supposed to
be listening and nobody
thinks of her because she's just the
receptionist yeah and when chad gets the
mail
[ __ ] chad she's like oh luke she's
not gonna notice then
of course she does and she's the key
that locks you know opens the whole
[ __ ] thing up you know if if if she
hadn't noticed that
um he could have gotten you know richard
could gotten away with it wouldn't have
had to
leave town and wouldn't eventually meet
up with with the
evil coop and all that sort of thing so
she's she's
very strongly key to the whole thing and
i like that
she's you know you have to you have to
remember you have to you know
keep that in your mind she's not just a
ditzy
confused person that doesn't understand
how someone can be in the city on the
phone and
and has no idea which chair if you want
to see
sheriff truman isn't here well do you
know which one
it could make a difference no ma'am
a one is sick and the other one is
fishing
oh it could make a difference
the another another actor that that uh
you know again could have been
you know if you know uh somebody that's
worked with david lynch a lot and but
also could have been like another famous
person oh
was it was uh it was naomi watts and she
sort of shows up as janie e
dougie's long-suffering wife man she's
been through some [ __ ]
you just can tell with her okay ducky
you're acting weird as [ __ ]
whoever ends up marrying dougie jones in
the first place you gotta wonder about
maybe
just from the little glimpses that we're
given of of the you know
dougie before he shows up that is
something i wish we got a little bit
more of
i would be interested i want to see
maybe that maybe the new show that david
lynch is working on maybe it'll be the
dougie jones prequel
how about that i'll watch that but i
think even in the in the context of this
series i think it would have been
beneficial to see a little bit more of
dougie before
just a little bit cooper replaces him
you get a lot of that through janie
that's true just your general
performance and the way she reacts to
him you can tell she's fed up with his
[ __ ]
i mean it's really interesting to think
about he shows up basically catatonic
and she's not really that worried you
were supposed to call them and set up a
time to pay them off and look
this shows up do you have an explanation
for this
jade jade
so that's her name is it jade give two
rides there were critics at the time
that were kind of talking about how the
women characters
were sort of like you know uh you know
portrayed as as just shrieking evil all
you know ever oh
screaming and all the men are all the
problem yeah and i really don't think
that holds true
um and like you know it could certainly
go that way
if you know the writing of the
performances weren't as good because but
janie is a perfect example of that like
she she's yelling at dougie all the time
because he
will not get his [ __ ] together like but
she won't get his [ __ ] together yeah
she and clearly she's used to this
clearly this is not something that's
just brand new
but i like her she's completely
justified in how angry she is at dougie
all the time
and she's so in control so smart and i
think the really the key scene with her
for me is
when she goes to pay off the gambling
debt what kind of world are we living in
where people can behave like this treat
other people this way without any
compassion
or feeling for their suffering now i
suggest you take a good long look at
yourselves because i never want to see
either of you again and then the the the
gangster's like well you're going to pay
this much more and it's just like no i'm
not
you know basically just no yeah and she
shuts it down so perfectly and they
don't have they just like
can't do anything about it because we've
never had anybody tell us off like this
and she's so in charge yeah and that's
her character all the way through like
she's trying to keep this family
together and raise
her son properly and and she's a very
strong character as far as i'm concerned
oh yeah
she's one of the highlights of the
season yeah and lucy as well you know
you're supposed to dismiss lucy as
as a as a ditz that doesn't understand
things but she
is the key to the whole thing um even
the the
uh sheriff truman's wife yeah first few
times we see her she she is kind of that
like nagging wife
character from like a sitcom or
something right i've been just waiting
at the house
in case dad needed a ride somewhere
you're impossible but then a few scenes
later a few episodes later
we get a scene where we explain that
their son committed suicide
and that like you know [ __ ] her up and
he's like oh okay this is why she's so
micromanaging things like this because
you know she's had this
gigantic loss and it's messed with her
exactly so it's like even things like
that where it's like
you have your your typical sitcom
nagging wife character but
you get a little more backstory and you
find out why they're like that yeah
he couldn't take being a soldier
also tammy fba isn't tammy she's there
she's there um i get that but i get the
kind of feeling the more
and more on rewatches too like you're
supposed to be really focusing on how
gordon's not quite right gordon likes
the young ladies a little too much
that was funny rewatching it i forgot
about this from the first time but
one of the it might be the last episode
or the second to last
uh where he he makes like this really
crude comment
i said you've gone soft in your old age
not where it counts buddy shockingly
crafts for david lynch take it easy i
know it's not david lynch it's gorgeous
but it just caught me off guard yeah but
i think i think
that's more and that's more something i
think about on this on more rewatches
too
like you know there's that one the
french woman in this room
trey sheik that he makes
poor albert just sit there forever he
takes her time getting out of there oh
jesus
everyone takes their time with
everything in this show that's true
and he's just he does not want to take
his time he's still albert
yeah i love that so much of the season
is
the two of them yes well tammy's there
too but
uh mainly those two like i would watch a
whole show of them yeah they're so funny
together
they are they're just yeah like like a
comedy team like a good
good comedy team listen she's here
visiting a friend of her mother
whose daughter has gone missing the
mother owns a turnip farm
i told her to tell the mother that her
daughter will turn up
eventually
she didn't get it either but but tammy's
main function
i mean because like we're talking about
like so much of the show is about
characters getting old
and she's kind of like the you know the
new new recruit she's younger she's kind
of learning the ropes
she's works is like a a
way to get exposition across yeah
because albert and gordon cole
they've been through this all together
they know all this [ __ ] they've got too
much forehand you got
you got to have somebody to explain what
the [ __ ] is happening for our sake so
tammy kind of works for that
and honestly i think christabel in her
key scene
like where she kind of like she knows
and you can the way
when you can tell is when gordon's
trying to comfort diane
outside the police station and she just
can't decide how to
how to stand yeah like nothing's
comfortable and that almost
feels like her telling us she's just i
know
i know i know what i'm what i am here
maybe maybe that's putting me putting
too much into it but it just kind of
felt that way to me that's true
we should talk about richard too we
should mention him we should talk about
richard's man
he's great in david lynch's career of
writing scumbag characters this is one
of the scubbiest
there's a lot of he reminds me a lot of
dennis hopper and blue velvet
uh just in terms of just like being a
complete scumbag
you recoil yeah from him like the second
he's on screen and he's a weird looking
dude
yeah yeah great looking but like he's
got perfect for the part he's got that
kind of like what's that angular
like yeah it's yeah it makes it just
makes them look like
evil talk sucking [ __ ] and i'll can't
hold that piece of [ __ ]
now give me some [ __ ] money
at that scene where he storms into his
grandmother's house and johnny's there
like still taking care of johnny still
still taking care of johnny but he's
like tied up to a chair because he was
running like crazy earlier and he had to
calm him down so he got this
weird bear that i'm sure david lynch
made himself sitting right in front of
how are you him
hello johnny how are you today that
scene is like that's like classic david
lynch stuff oh yeah that that
perfect balance of this is weird and
funny but also terrifying
completely terrifying because he's you
know richard is so menacing
he's so intimidating yeah he beats up
his grandma oh
that's that's where we're at in this
world yeah yeah
and and poor ben because ben's changed
ben is not he's basically not evil
anymore he just wants to
run the lodge and just is exasperated by
all the other people
that's true yeah there'd be a certain
point where you'd think like well that
character could have like
you know collaborated with him and there
would have been like a new generation of
horned evils like
no he's taking it all he's that much of
a he's that much of a bad guy
yeah he's cleared all out
which is oh man and just just the the
the idea of
you know who he is you know that that
evil coop
raped audrey in the hospital while she
was in a coma and that's why that [ __ ]
exists
it's like yeah i mean that's an overall
theme of the season too is this kind of
birth of evil yeah yeah with him
specifically but then yeah
at a much larger scale which i don't
even know i don't even know how we're
gonna start talking about this [ __ ]
i don't know man is that where we're at
are we there no let's not go there yet
okay that's we might have to take a
break before we get into that
let's see i've got this you know bottle
of bourbon there oh oh that's where
we're at case you want it
why you have to make something so simple
so [ __ ] difficult
[ __ ]
and talking about performances we did
just kind of skip over
kyle [ __ ] mclaughlin yes if you get
nothing else out of this season
what a phenomenal performances not just
performances basically four
yeah four performances which is amazing
and
they're all completely different but
they're all the same yeah
it's crazy it's it's it's an actor is it
you know
highest achievement you can even think
of doing something like that he's so
good
yeah and that feels like you could only
get to that place if you have
the history that david lynch and him
have working together for so many years
and you know same with laura dern which
we can talk about her too but
uh but yeah kyle mclaughlin is just i
mean this is
i some people hate dougie but for me
this is the dougie jones show
it is i i think that's the highlight of
the season
oh my god it really wins you over or won
me over in a way that i wasn't expecting
it was so it just it's so funny and fun
and sweet
which you don't necessarily you don't
know that's going to happen from from
the beginning of his story
you know yeah he's cheating on his wife
in some empty house somewhere
you know whoever this dougie guy is um
but it turns out to be just
just a real central thing in the whole
series
you know not just not just that you
obviously every episode you're waiting
for
you know the group to come back to full
you know when you get that frustration
of like i love
like the way that that uh mike back in
the black lodge is still just like don't
don't die oh
well there's a good uh kind of
self-referential moment with mike when
when cooper finally comes out of of his
doggy stage
another good audience surrogate moment
yeah exactly
but yeah dougie jones i mean kyle
mclaughlin's performance it's like
he has lines of dialogue but it feels
like something right out of a like a
silent movie
like a yeah like a harold lloyd or or
buster keaton or yeah but back to back
to eraserhead it's kind of
yeah yeah he's kind of yeah that's true
the way he walks around charlie chaplin
kind of thing yeah we got
when we talked about eraser i talked
about how inexplicably funny it is just
seeing him standing
in that elevator waiting for the
elevator doors to close and that's
dougie man
there's moments like that in this if i
were to just
i in re-watching that there's one shot
that i think encapsulates
the entirety of this show this season
okay all right
everybody's facing to exit the elevator
dougie's got us back to the camera
they're like doggy come on get the [ __ ]
out of the way it's like everything
everyone in that elevator
those are other tv shows the dougie
jones is twin peaks yeah
yeah yep it perfectly encapsulates
everything
oh man hi we cracked up so hard with him
in the casino
initially we're we're introduced to what
cooper is in
in dougie's body which is he's you know
basically cat tonic he'll move around
you know he'll stand up and go around if
you push him yeah but otherwise he
doesn't know what he's doing at all
he needs to be directed everywhere yeah
he's like he's like a
a baby in a full-size body that knows
you know has balance
yeah basically um and no you know a guy
with money in the casino what's he
wanted you know everybody thinks he's
there to gamble it because that's what
casinos are for
yeah makes perfect sense so they uh the
security guard stops him pushes him over
to meg foster
yeah meg foster shows up for five
seconds why not
um and she gives him the change and then
mr jackpots is born
yeah mr jackpots i love that so much mr
jackpots
mr jackpots mr jackpots
it's almost like forrest gump like i
think at forrest gump everybody loves
that movie but when i watch that's like
he just does whatever anybody tells him
to
this almost feels like a play on that
it's like you gotta direct him where to
go and then the the
the white lodge is is leading him on his
journey every step of the way
yeah that old lady thank
you thank you mr jackman but she i mean
she represents what kind of becomes a
thing with dougie too
is you know so i can understand people's
patience being kind of worn by dougie
but
he ends up being just such a like
positive force everything he touches
everything he touches he makes better
mm-hmm which i mean that's cooper too as
a cooper was always this positive force
and that's what this world has been
missing yeah
that's why everything's gonna turn to
[ __ ] it's amazing that that part of him
is what
can come through even even that sort of
handicap even when he's comatose
yeah but he changes that old lady's life
i mean he he turns around dougie
and it is point important to point out
that we call him dougie jones it is
cooper
when you complain about cooper not being
here he's in the whole show oh he's
there he's
he's just not you know he's not there
yeah the real dougie jones
he he gets uh obliterated in the uh the
red room
but that's what happens to the real
dougie jones he's gone you know we call
him dougie jones it is cooper
he's there for the whole thing but yeah
and so yeah he yeah he uh
he fixes that old lady's life he uh
turns the bad guy at
the office into into a contrite good guy
just by not drinking coffee yeah
that bad huh he turns gangsters into
good guys
mitchum brothers giving him pies
he makes jim belushi into someone i like
to watch jimbalushi's best performance
since jingle all the way
so good i love those guys yeah
i love this guy
dougie
dougie jones and then the the payoff to
all that ends up being surprisingly
emotional and sweet when cooper's
finally back and he's
he genuinely means it when he says like
the time i've spent with you has meant a
lot to me
but i want to tell you how much i've
enjoyed spending time with both of you
you've made my heart so full you really
feel for that kid like it's
it's amazing what started out as this
goofy comedy stick where he's wearing
like
his his tie on his head and spitting out
coffee
that it could go from there all the way
to i mean when
we get uh you know we create another
tulpa that becomes duggy because
cooper being the good guy that he is
doesn't want this family to lose their
father so yeah he just creates another
one for him
a better dougie a better dougie in that
shot when they open the door and they
all embrace
it's like one of the sweetest things
yeah david lynch has ever shown
it ends up completely sweet and
heartwarming this is great yeah so
you've got that through line through the
entire thing
and you can follow that because that's
your that's a good and evil still
starting to meet
because we didn't talk about we haven't
talked much about evil coupe yet
oh yeah which is again just in terms of
performance
man so intimidating yeah we're doing
very little
very very little like external work i
mean you could tell that there's a lot
of people behind those eyes but oh yeah
but he's so
stoic yeah well he's in control
he knows no one can touch him there's
that part early on i think it's the
first scene with him when he goes into
that
that house and it's so good
but yeah the the key line with him with
that control thing is him saying
at certain times they're like doesn't
want i'm trying to eat
i don't oh i don't need the coordinates
i want them and i'll follow up on that
contact of mine
hopefully get the information you need
want
not need
i don't need anything right
and that's that's evil coop in a
nutshell just like he doesn't
need [ __ ] he's got it he's going to get
what he's going to get yeah
and i think the whole like his whole
plan as far as i can tell is that he
doesn't want to go back to the black
lodge
he wants to continue wreaking havoc on
earth he just wants to be evil
yeah he's got to figure out how to do
that and he spends a lot of time laying
the groundwork
you know he sets up dougie he sets up
you know a whole criminal network but we
know how tough he is
because he arm wrestles jason voorhees
at one point that's right and he kicks
his ass
it hurt my arm when you moved it down
here
yeah but just that in that even tone
he never gets angry yeah there's no
wasted energy he's like
yeah just like like a character that
just moves cuts through everything
